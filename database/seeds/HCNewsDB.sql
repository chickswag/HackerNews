Much like with Covid today, scientists are interested in understanding when the disease first appeared. Because that gives us clues about where it came from and how quickly it is changing now. You can estimate this based on changes in the sequence of the genome. Changes (mutations) will appear in the genome at a predictable rate (&quot;mutation rate&quot;), and is measured as mutations per generation.For HIV, there are plenty of estimates for the mutation rate based off a mixture of statistical bioinformatics and knowledge of genetics. But they are all inferences because we don&#x27;t have many sequences from before 1988. This relatively ancient genome allows scientists to see how good their estimates are by looking at a genome that will have -20 years worth of mutations. Turns out the estimates are really good.

I too am awaiting the time when all I need to be expert in a new technology is to just go buy the plugin I&#x27;ll insert into my brain (hopefully we&#x27;ll become cyborgs, that&#x27;s my optimism) but until then is grind &amp; RTFM.','comment',23359415,'unnouinceput',23347357,'[23360309, 23359688]',NULL,'2020-05-30 06:12:19','2020-05-31 08:30:29'),(158,202,'I can relate a lot to this.

That fired my imagination also, and I wondered how we could do such a thing in a scientific manner. Given the rules of the Standard Model, in principle almost all aspects of the surface conditions could be elucidated, but I feel we would be missing almost all of the essence of it. Just like a deep understanding of Quantum Electrodynamics won&#x27;t help you determine from first-principles that Earth has pretty sunsets or that your hair stands up if you take a wool jumper off.For example, the surface of a neutron star would be very bright in gamma rays, but those are subject to pair-production in the strong magnetic field of the star, making light effectively a short range sensory mechanism. Meanwhile, the enormous density of the crust means that it transmits sound incredibly well and at enormous speeds[2], making acoustics the equivalent of our photon-based vision sense!

In pop science, it was spoken in reverent tones. Never mind that they never gave a definition of it that didn&#x27;t sound trivial -- the word was dripping with meaning and the promise of hidden wisdom.I went to college and studied physics. I learned how the behavior of many atoms leads to thermodynamics and the properties of materials. I learned how elementary quantum mechanics leads to atomic physics and chemistry. I learned how the strong force gives rise to nuclei. I learned how the Standard Model produces everything on this list. I learned how, at each layer, the correspondence was fiendishly subtle, but the work of thousands of physicists over decades had built the bridges.At the end of it, I was still dissatisfied, because I hadn&#x27;t learned what emergence was. I&#x27;d see crackpots presenting their personal theories of everything, declaring that they knew what no physicist ever could, because their model had emergence. They knew about it, and we didn&#x27;t. But I still didn&#x27;t know what it was.Then I dug deeper and it became obvious. Emergence is a beautiful idea that has always been present, in some form or another, in every field of science. It is so well-developed in some fields, such as particle physics, that it has become a suite of quantitative methods with incredible accuracy. I had been learning it the entire time, and now use it every day without a second thought. Meanwhile, &quot;emergence&quot; is a brand name. It&#x27;s a specific word passed down over generations of pop science used to convey mystique. It&#x27;s a tool some charlatans use to pretend they know more than they do.No offense meant to the article, but I often hear people say they&#x27;re most excited about some substanceless theory because it &quot;has emergence&quot;, and this is part of why.','comment',23358662,'knzhou',23357506,'[23359641, 23359253, 23358805]',NULL,'2020-05-30 03:15:54','2020-05-31 08:31:05'),(188,205,'This whole article reeks of &quot;science is BS, we need free will for humans to be real and morally responsible&quot;.For all of its smart wording, this amounts to the same old issue Aristotle had with describing the mathematical universe in which somehow humans are different enough to warrant &quot;higher stuff&quot;.Is there any useful criticism of science besides pseudo-attacks always coming from antropocentric, and usually religious, corners?

All that is needed is communication. This can be gravity for stardust to form planet systems; using once eyes to form bird flocks; using chemicals for communication to form ant colonies; using human communication to form societies.Once during my diving lecture, the lecturer pointed out, that we can, in many cases, call self organisation simply an eco system.

Now I&#x27;ve migrated most of my setups both privately and professionally to containers.

The network abstraction has its price in complexity when doing diagnostics.You could solve networking differently than in Kubernetes with IPv6. There is not a need for complicated IPv4 nat schemes.

If you have too much load it will autoscale pod, if node is overloaded it will autoscale node pool, if you have a memory leak it will restart the app so you can sleep at night. I can provide a million examples that make our 100+ microservices management so much simpler. No Linux kungfu, 0 bash scrips, no SSH,  and interaction with OS, not a single devops role for 15+ developers team.Our management of cluster is just a simple  &quot;add more CPU or memory to this nodepool&quot;, sometimes change a nodepool name for deployment for certain service. All done simple cloud management UI.\nFor those who call microservices fancy stuff. No, we are a startup with fast delivery, deploy cycle. We have tons of subproject , integrations, and our main languages are nodejs, golang and python. Some of these are not good at multi-thread so no way to run it as a monolith. The other one is used only when it&#x27;s needed for high performance. \nSo All together Microservices + Kubernetes + Helm + good CI + proper pubsub gives our backend extremely simple fast cycle of development, delivery, and what&#x27;s important flexibility in terms of language&#x2F;framework&#x2F;version.What is also good is the installation of services.

All of that could be put in a JSON file, which is far less complex.YAML should not even be needed for Kubernetes. Configuration should be representable in a purely declarative way, instead of making the YAML mess, with all kinds of references and stuff. Perhaps the configuration specification needs to be re-worked. Many projects using YAML feel to me like a configuration trash can, where you just add more and more stuff, which you haven&#x27;t thought about.I once tried moving an already containerized system to Kubernetes for testing, how that would work. It was a nightmare. It was a few years ago, maybe 3 years ago. Documentation was plenty but really sucked. I could not find _any_ documentation of what can be put into that YAML configuration file, what the structure really is. I read tens of pages of documentation, none of it helped me to find, what I needed. Then even to set everything up, to get the Kubernetes running at all also took way too much time and 3 people to figure out and was badly documented. It took multiple hours on at least 2 days. Necessary steps, I still remember, not being listed on one single page in any kind of overview, but somewhere a required step was hidden on another documentation page, that was not even mentioned in the list of steps to take.Finally having set things up, I had a web interface in front of me, where I was supposed to be able to configure pods or something. Only, that I could not configure everything I had in my already containerized system, via that web interface. It seems that this web interface was only meant for the most basic use cases, where one does not need to provide containers with much configuration. My only remaining option was to upload a YAML file, which was undocumented, as far as I could see back then. That&#x27;s were I stopped. A horrible experience and I wish not to have it again.There were also naming issues. There was something called &quot;Helm&quot;. To me that sounds like an Emacs package. But OK I guess we have these naming issues everywhere in software development. Still bugs me though, as it feels like Google pushes down its naming of things into many people&#x27;s minds and sooner or later, most people will associate Google things with names, which have previously meant different things.There were 1 or 2 layers of abstraction in Kubernetes, which I found completely useless for my use-case and wished they were not there, but of course I had to deal with them, as the system is not flexible to allow me to only have layers I need. I just wanted to run my containers on multiple machines, balancing the load and automatically restarting on crashes, you know, all the nice things Erlang offers already for ages.I feel like Kubernetes is the Erlang ecosystem for the poor or uneducated, who&#x27;ve never heard of other ways, with features poorly copied.If I really needed to bring a system to multiple servers and scale and load balance, I&#x27;d rather look into something like Nomad. Seems much simpler and also offers load balancing over multiple machines and can run docker containers and normal applications as well, plus I was able to set it up in less than an hour or so, having to servers in the system.','comment',23356187,'zelphirkalt',23354418,'[23357114]',NULL,'2020-05-29 20:17:07','2020-05-31 08:33:17'),(296,208,'I completely understand the use case for Kubernetes when you&#x27;re dealing with languages that require a lot of environment config, like Python.I&#x27;ve never really thought it was that useful for (for example) nodejs, where you can just npm install your whole environment and deps, and off you go.','comment',23355732,'claytongulick',23354418,'[23356258]',NULL,'2020-05-29 19:25:20','2020-05-31 08:33:18'),(297,208,'tl;dr - Kubernetes is a good tool, but it has been marketed and evangelized to where it is today, it&#x27;s meteoric rise is not organic.I am a huge Kubernetes fan, and think that it is a good and necessary tool with little accidental complexity (most concepts are there because you will likely need them and&#x2F;or that they are a valid concern), but my position is that the growth of Kubernetes has not been organic -- it&#x27;s been heavily promoted and marketed and pushed to where it is today.Let&#x27;s compare a project like Ansible first release in 2012[0], and the first AnsibleFest is in 2016[0]. Ansible is a very useful abstraction&#x2F;force multiplier for doing ops. If a dedicated conference is a measure of community&#x2F;enthusiasm reaching a fever pitch, it took 4 years for Ansible to reach critical mass. Kubernetes had it&#x27;s first Kubecon in 2015[1] ONE year after it&#x27;s initial release in 2014[2]. Did it reach critical mass 4x quicker than ansible? Maybe, but I think the simpler explanation is that the people who want Kubernetes to succeed know that creating buzz and the appearance of widespread adoption and community is more important than it actually being there, as it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once you have enough onlookers, people motivated to work on open source (i.e. give away labor, time and energy for free) will come improve your project with you, serve as an initial user base, your biggest promoters, all the while strengthening your ecosystem.Another interesting side to this is how thoroughly Kubernetes seems to be crushing it&#x27;s competition -- DC&#x2F;OS (Mesos), Nomad and other competition are not fighting a functionality war, they&#x27;re fighting a marketing war. DC&#x2F;OS and Nomad are not obviously worse in function, but certainly don&#x27;t compare when you consider ecosystem size (perceived, if not actual) and brand. It&#x27;s a winner-take-most scenario and tech companies are particularly good at seizing this kind of opportunity. Of course, if you compare the resources of the entities backing these projects, it&#x27;s clear who was going to win the marketing war.In a world of free tiers as a good way to get people locked in, developer evangelists who build essentially propaganda projects (no matter how cool they are), and shrinking attention spans, Kubernetes is a good tool which has marketed itself to greatness. In it&#x27;s wake there are efforts like the CNCF which I struggle to characterize because it&#x27;s hard to differentiate their efforts to standardize from an effort to bureaucratize. I&#x27;m almost certainly blinded by my own cynicism but most of this just doesn&#x27;t feel organic. Big, useful open source software gets world-renowned after years&#x2F;decades of being convenient&#x2F;useful&#x2F;correct&#x2F;etc but Kubernetes (and other projects given the CNCF gold star) seem to be trying to skip this process or at least bootstrap a reputation out of the gate.DevOps traditionally moved much slower -- I can remember what seemed like an age of &quot;salt vs ansible vs chef&quot;, with all three technologies having had lots of times to prove themselves useful. Even the switch to containers instead of VM&#x2F;user based process isolation took more time than Kubernetes has taken to dominate the zeitgeist.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ansible_(software)[1]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voxuspr.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;what-is-kubecon-its-past-pres...[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kubernetes','comment',23358764,'hardwaresofton',23354418,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-30 03:36:10','2020-05-31 08:33:19'),(298,208,'I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell you.What I can tell you, is that the unbelievable bloat in the complexity of our systems is going to bite us in the ass.

And most of the value in a static type system is the ability to flag errors before running the program, so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything you can add to the browser that would have obviated an offline tool for that.Frankly, I think we&#x27;d be better off if we started getting a lot more selective about what gets added to browsers. Adding more and more features to browser&#x27;s js implementations is silly when most folks are using ahead of time build steps to get access to those features without the browser&#x27;s help. And continuing to add things is a great way to ensure that they&#x27;ll keep right on using those tools, so they don&#x27;t have to worry (as much) about who supports what. And it just makes the barrier of entry for building browsers higher and higher.There&#x27;s more utility when native browser support can do something a compiler can&#x27;t. Things like reducing code size for really widely used functionality, enabling technologies that can&#x27;t be bootsraped through developer tools (e.g. WebRTC).

There was a point during the release of AS3 that some of us thought that Flash and the Web was eventually going to converge.&gt; For more details on politics and history of ES4, check out this great article on the auth0 blog [1].ECMAScript 4 was actually quite nice, Typescript like but ActionScript3 (AS3) was a great implementation of it.  The classes, events, types (was also dynamic) and more were just so right.I used a ton of AS3 in Flash games, Flex and that moment just before mobile took over the world in 2008.  From 2005-2008 Flash vs Silverlight was a massive thing and Flash video had revolutionized the world earlier with Youtube and others.  Macromedia was a great company and I wish that Microsoft had bought them (they owned part) instead of Adobe.The big problem I think was that ultimately it was Macromedia that really started the movement and then Adobe bought them and was really pushing the charge with AS3&#x2F;ES4 and it went right at the other tech companies platforms. Flex before apps was really webapps done right for a time.Silverlight was ES3 and Google had lots invested in Javascript with Maps&#x2F;Gmail&#x2F;Docs&#x2F;etc. Microsoft and Google did not like that Adobe was leading it as they ran both big browsers at the time in IE&#x2F;Chrome and killed off ES4 to go to the ES5 on path. Apple ninja&#x27;d in with apps in 2008 and one upped them all with WebGL, Canvas for a plugin free web (Flash&#x2F;Silverlight EOL&#x27;d without notice) and OpenGL ES, Obj-C&#x2F;C++ for app&#x2F;handheld games. Apple and apps signaled a move away from the plugin web to standards web and native apps for better or worse with gave platform owners in appstores&#x2F;browser more control of what technology is used.It is too bad, I think javascript would look more like TypeScript and be less of a mess today, this is coming from someone that loves javascript since the late 90s.Side note: I love all of Anders Hejlsberg language&#x2F;platform design in Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C# and TypeScript and Danish by ancestors so maybe I am biased.

Basically it left a whole bunch of the spec ambiguous with differing engine behaviours.On top of that, the spec was massive, included a lot of kitchen sink style accumulation of language features - I can’t recall which feature it was, but I do remember when some language showed a new feature it was almost immediately shoehorned into ES4.And while a lot of the work was on static typing, more time was consumed by academic features of little real world value - object capabilities were a huge drain on committee time and complexity of many features.The end result was that ES4 as a spec was far too large to implement, didn’t solve The very obvious major problems with the existing spec, and didn’t actually provide much in the way of features that people were asking for.Incidentally the reason we have for(of) in javascript is because that would be ambiguous with the type syntax designed in ES4. The reason I couldn’t use for each was because of the other spec this article talks about: E4X.Both of these were language specifications pushed by Mozilla and a few academic PLT folk with little-to-no interest in other implementer feedback.At this point even ECMA has retired E4X (it’s been withdrawn, or whatever language ECMA uses for a spec that no longer exists)','comment',23359201,'olliej',23354637,'[23359898]',NULL,'2020-05-30 05:23:41','2020-05-31 08:35:49'),(390,220,'The explanation I heard was that E4X died at the time because (a) JSON developed by the early&#x2F;mid 2000s to compete with XML and (b) XHTML would so easily break in strict browsers that the web was pushed in the direction of HTML5 instead of XHTML. In short, there was a rather large backlash against “enterprise” technologies like XML, WS-* and Flash (in some circles) in favour of HTML Microformats, REST and JSON. This is roughly around the same time when AJAX moved from shipping XML (2003-4) to shipping bits of HTML (PJAX) or using JSON APIs via AJAX or JSONP. The thinking of the day was if XHTML 2.0 was dead on arrival, then we should probably back out the E4X changes as “from another era.” CORS is a great example, the original CORS was “Authorizing Read Access to XML Content Using the &lt;?access-control?&gt; Processing Instruction 1.0” from 2005: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;2005&#x2F;NOTE-access-control-20050613&#x2F; which in 2007 became a header, then several headers, then the CORS specs we’re a bit more familiar with by 2009 as Chrome was introduced.Worth noting that compiling new syntax to old is also not new — anybody remember CoffeeScript? I’d say if there’s a new part, it’s the prevalence of implementations of standards and of polyfills for them in both TypeScript and core-js via Babel such that you can confidently write code in new syntax knowing you wouldn’t have to rewrite it later. Nobody remembers CoffeeScript or sees it today because it was generally all converted to JS long ago — it wasn’t a syntax we could build on top of. Arguably, if it was, you’d still see projects using it today, but it’s hard to modify syntax in an unambiguous way (for parsers I mean) while also simplifying the syntax as CoffeeScript did. Implementing standards are safer, though until implemented and shipped in multiple browsers, anything could still change. There are a few places where TypeScript has to be changed or will be changed due to changes in the JS standard...To illustrate how messed up standards can still be though, I’d present “decorators” —- seemingly a solved problem in Babel or TS but apparently very hard to implement as a standard: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-decorators I’m beginning to think JSX will ship in browsers before decorators do ;-)That said if there’s something the web community learned from ECMAScript 4 and XHTML2 it’s that usage, what people want to use and working code, always wins out over arbitrary standards. If two options are good enough, the one folks implement and use will win when it comes to standards. To this end, I’m pretty sure future standards required 2 independent implementations to actually graduate and become standards instead of remaining proposals. Not sure how that will change if Chrome ever becomes a larger monoculture than it already is... maybe web developers will have to vote with their codebases as standards bodies write and distribute polyfills to encourage their spec to “win”.','comment',23358773,'lstamour',23354637,'[23358908]',NULL,'2020-05-30 03:38:23','2020-05-31 08:35:50'),(391,220,'&gt; The closest thing we had for ES4, was probably Flash Actionscript 3.No.Flash = a browser pluginActionScript 3 = a programming languageActionScript 3 can run in other runtimes than just FlashAdobe AIR is another runtime, target desktop (Windows, macOS) and mobile (iOS, Android).Redtamarin is yet another runtime (based on the avmplus) target the command-line and server-side (Windows, macOS, Linux).','comment',23360073,'zwetan',23354637,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-30 08:32:10','2020-05-31 08:35:52'),(392,221,'I wrote my first web app with Django.

In the world of Rails, Django, Laravel and Phoenix this is a configuration task, with existing libraries. In Javascript it was a slog getting the implementation that still lacked much of the functionality of these mature frameworks (there are notification frameworks for Javascript but it was decided not to use them - &quot;no frameworks&quot;!). While it is fun to implement your own thing, here the reasons behind the existence of the code are essentially developer vanity in thinking their notification situation is an absolutely special case, and developer desire to do something stimulating like develop a notification system rather than serve product, organisational or user needs.To have a clear discussion of this, however, it might be useful to define &quot;framework&quot;. Is the target here frontend or backend frameworks? One thing I have observed is in the frontend world frameworks have caused some core skills to atrophy. For example, how many Javascript front end engineers can now confidently, given you click on something, change the colour of it. Probably here a framework is wildly overkill and you will get there with plain Javascript until such a point as complex user interaction is needed.Realise rhetorically there is less punch to &quot;use a framework mindfully&quot; but this should be basic to any engineering decision &quot;use a language mindfully&quot; and in the last instance &quot;do we need to solve this with software&quot;?

Instead of using 53 bits to represent 52 bits, use 60 bits, and now you can perform 256 sequential additions with no carrying between words before the carry part saturates and needs to be handled.Somewhat surprisingly, it&#x27;s even possible to use this construction in the context of a quantum computation [2][3]. The reason it&#x27;s surprising is because tacking on additional registers like this can act as an information leakage mechanism (which is an error in a quantum computation). For analogy, you can imagine that if you computed a public key using this trick that you would not be comfortable handing an attacker the registers storing your public key before you removed the carry padding that made the computation faster. But it turns out that if you just initialize the carry padding randomly, subtracting out of the next word at the start to ensure everything sums to the correct result at the end, then you can show that the information leakage and chance-of-bad-overflow is exponentially suppressed in the length of the carry padding. Currently the most efficient known way to implement Shor&#x27;s algorithm uses this technique [4].1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carry-save_adder2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.084883: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;upTipX9yXNg?t=7774: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.09749','comment',23354698,'Strilanc',23351007,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-29 17:51:03','2020-05-31 09:26:15'),(434,224,'&gt; Aside: Why 13 bits instead of 12?

As a result, we can assign 52 bits to the most significant limb and ignore the fact that it will run out of room for carries before the other limbs do.If you&#x27;re going to wrap, you could go all the way and assign 64 bits to the most significant limb; that way you save 12 bits which you can spread to the other four limbs.

It makes the situation even worse because those with free distribution channels will buy all price-fixed products and leave nothing for Amazon customers.','comment',23353385,'toohotatopic',23351132,'[23353688, 23356123, 23357829, 23353452, 23357613, 23354646, 23355050, 23354691, 23355650, 23355736, 23355895, 23357009, 23358255, 23353548, 23354702, 23353624, 23354653, 23353514, 23355928, 23354056, 23359603, 23355899, 23353550, 23355450]',NULL,'2020-05-29 16:04:08','2020-05-31 09:27:03'),(458,225,'I know they&#x27;re huge and I&#x27;m just pissing in the ocean, but I do just about everything I can these days to buy elsewhere.

Airplane control software should not be allowed to have bugs. CPUs should not be allowed to have bugs. And OS&#x27;s should not be allowed to crash (looking at you Microsoft).When one of these things happens, in my opinion the correct response is _not_ to just release fixes and workarounds and then say &quot;we&#x27;ll try really hard to not let it happen again.&quot; You do that, sure. But the first time you see airplane software malfunction, that means you need to change the way the software is written and released so that the whole class of issues will not ever happen again.

If you have to hire mathematicians to formally prove the critical paths of the software, you do that.

As the article points out, they&#x27;re made from similar materials, using the same fabrication technologies, except that PV panels include some plastic; and TEGs typically use exotic, scarce semiconductors based on heavy metals, like bismuth telluride or lead telluride, rather than abundant, cheap semiconductors like silicon.  (Silicon is too good at conducting heat to make a good TEG.)  I guess Kris De Decker just really doesn&#x27;t like plastic!  But a much bigger issue is that PV panels usually last decades, except for the small minority that get smashed, while TEGs tend to get burned up because you have to put them in a fire to make them work, and even aside from the danger of accidental overheating (because your water tank emptied out, say, or the air currents in your wood stove were different from usual) the Arrhenius equation governs a wide variety of TEG and PV failure mechanisms.  So TEGs are not &quot;more reliable&quot;.The article argues that solar panels are not being recycled because they have plastic in them.  This is false.  The truth is that solar panels are not being recycled because almost all of them still work, even those manufactured decades ago, and manufacturing is growing rapidly, so there is not a sufficiently large pool of broken solar panels to supply any significant fraction of the demand for silicon.TEGs are not &quot;less costly&quot; than solar panels.  Solar panels are https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solarserver.de&#x2F;pv-modulpreise&#x2F; €0.17 per watt now.  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dx.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;yb3981-diy-150-c-thermoelectric-power-g... is a TEG rated for 150° which can theoretically produce about 3 watts for US$9: 15 times as expensive.  Typical PV capacity factors are around 20%†, so even if the TEG got a 100% capacity factor — which it won&#x27;t, since you don&#x27;t have a constant 3-watt load to hang off it — it would be three times more costly.  (Is there a cheaper source for TEGs somewhere?)  This also tends to show that more energy and materials are needed to manufacture TEGs than equivalent solar panels, since that&#x27;s what most of your money goes to buy.(150° is about the limit for bismuth-telluride TEGs — bismuth alloys and intermetallics tend to melt at low temperatures.  It is not true that, as the article says, that &quot;the hot side of bismuth telluride modules withstands continuous temperatures of 150 to 350 degrees&quot;, nor are Bi₂Te₃ modules &quot;the most efficient ones&quot;.)The article argues that TEGs are &quot;100% efficient&quot; because any energy not harvested by the TEG is used to heat your house.  Aside from this being undesirable in the summer — a significant concern for many of us here in the &quot;global south&quot; that Kris De Decker pretends to care about, from his apartment in Spain — it&#x27;s also the case that burning up kilowatts of precious energy directly into low-grade heat is an extremely inefficient way to heat your house.  The apartment I&#x27;m in here is primarily heated by an air conditioner with the capability of functioning backwards, in which mode it produces about 3 kilowatts of heating in exchange for a single kilowatt of electricity, for 300% &quot;efficiency&quot;.  (This is not a violation of thermodynamics; the Carnot cycle is reversible, and the indoor and outdoor temperatures just aren&#x27;t that far apart.)  Producing the same amount of heating with the oven or a wood stove would waste two kilowatts of gas or wood.Additionally, wood stoves are seriously fucking bad for your health.  They produce massive amounts of carcinogenic smoke.TEGs do have real merits — I&#x27;ve loved them since I was a kid.  They can provide small amounts of power, at very low efficiency, in a totally autonomous, independent, and portable way.  You might be able to charge your phone, run a reading light, or trickle-charge a battery.  But they are not an alternative power source for your house.  They are not going to run your vacuum cleaner or your e-scooter, contrary to the misleading illustrations in this article.  A normal household vacuum cleaner needs 500–2000 watts, and at 5% efficiency that would mean running 10 to 40 kilowatts of heat through your TEG, a power level at which you will quickly cease to appreciate the space heating effect.  However, as John Nagle pointed out in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23356206, the end-to-end efficiency in the Lebanese study cited was not 5% but 0.04%, because most of the energy in the fuel goes right out the chimney, and most of the rest goes directly into the house, not through the TEG.So what could have motivated such a mendacious article?  Did Low Tech Magazine get an advertorial contract, similar to The Atlantic&#x27;s famous David Miscavige Leads Scientology to Another Banner Year deal?  Does Kris De Decker simply have no interest in whether what he&#x27;s writing is true or false, scraping together whatever argument he thinks he can trick people into believing in order to support his preconceived conclusion?  Either way, this article destroys the credibility of Low Tech Magazine.  (Unless it&#x27;s a false-flag operation?  Maybe someone is impersonating Kris De Decker to discredit him?)† In polar countries like Germany, the Netherlands, or England, PV capacity factors may worsen to 10%.  Near the Arctic or Antarctic Circle things are even worse, and within them of course you can&#x27;t use solar power without a seasonal energy store, which is totally impractical for most uses.','comment',23358625,'kragen',23348578,'[23364196, 23360194]',NULL,'2020-05-30 03:02:42','2020-05-31 09:28:34'),(529,229,'Randall Munroe (xkcd) did a video [0] a while back to promote his book &quot;How To&quot; where he addressed several (mostly silly) ways of powering a hypothetical home using only energy gathered on-site.

You start working with people who are less qualified because either they are volunteers or they are the only people you can afford. You start taking worse terms with customers because you need this money to survive the next few months or make the next payroll.

One of the great things about the rise in startups, accelerators, and VCs is that starting companies has become a career option for far more of the population.The rest of the argument just degenerates from there:No skin in the game: try telling that to a founder who’s taken a 50–80% pay cut and probably started off working for free to get their company funded, but who owns big chunk of the equity and can pay themselves properly if they get to product market fit and hit a growth curve.Ruthless execution, faster path to growth etc. Nonsense! I’ve come across plenty of small startups or individual founders that carried on far too long after they should have admitted failure because of the sunk cost fallacy. Team keeps taking sacrifices - cut all costs, less pay, work for equity, etc. But while you’re small enough you can do this nearly indefinitely. Taking funding forces you to aim for something bigger and you’re either going to win, close down, pivot, or get acquired.

Or just the fastest path to growth at any non-monetary cost so you can make the next payroll? Sure it might be cash sustainable growth but could be unsustainable in other ways such as making ever higher promises to keep customers buying more, allowing all sorts of unscrupulous purchases of user data, or shipping software without any modicum of security.&gt; You now have no choice but to be ruthlessly focused on the things that impact your bottom line (i.e. pay the bills)Or you end up cutting corners and compromising on the product just to get some cash in the door.

You can hire people to help you out without having to worry about your ability to pay them.Personally? I found the tradeoff to be worth it and raised money for my current company.

Swift is really interesting to me because it is very similar in practice to Kotlin, but with some very cool and powerful additional language features. So, if server-side Swift has a smaller footprint at runtime and equal or better performance than Kotlin on the JVM[1], that&#x27;d be a really compelling language for me.[1] yes, I know GraalVM&#x2F;native options exist for Kotlin, but every time I&#x27;ve tried to investigate ecosystem compatibility, it leads to me glancing at pages long-articles about &quot;how to configure X framework for GraalVM&quot; that make it not seem worth the effort yet','comment',23354668,'avolcano',23352501,'[23355346, 23355713, 23356016, 23355118, 23355349]',NULL,'2020-05-29 17:48:26','2020-05-31 09:30:54'),(630,237,'If you have tons of Swift code that needs to run in watchOS, iOS, iPadOS AND the cloud, this would kinda make sense... but how frequently is that the case?

You could even call it speed vs accuracy and add a third factor like cost. This is largest the difference between the biggest companies like Android vs Windows vs Apple and even programming languages like PHP vs Python.Most companies optimise for speed and a lower cost and wonder why their products are a pile of crap. Optimising for speed also means taking more ethical shortcuts and bad code in hope of rectifying them later and sacrificing everything for faster outcomes.

I honestly most databases are too hard to use and there&#x27;s been no major improvements here in the last few decades.Take Postgres. You write code in SQL, a programming language unlike any other mainstream programming language. Instead of writing code with for loops and if statements, you write it with joins and where clauses. On top of that, Postgres has a &quot;magical query optimizer&quot; that takes your SQL and figures out how to execute your query. Unless you have a good understanding of indexes and how they impact the query optimizer, you&#x27;ll have a hard time getting Postgres to be fast. I still regularly say WTF when optimizing Postgres queries even though I&#x27;ve been doing it for years. That&#x27;s not to mention there&#x27;s tons of database specific terminology like tables, rows, schema, etc, that you have to learn before you can become an effect user of Postgres.As much as HN likes to bash it, I think Mongo has done the best job of creating an easy to use database. With Mongo, you can store JSON and you can pull JSON out. Of course, I would never use Mongo personally.I&#x27;m hoping that Supabase is able to bring about the next-phase of databases by not just making it possible to make a database fast, but by making it easy to do so.','comment',23324311,'malisper',23319901,'[23325709]',NULL,'2020-05-27 12:56:13','2020-05-31 09:36:40'),(840,248,'Was going to quip that I built a homegrown version of this in elixir which is the best stack to implement something like this if you want it to be scalable.Then I saw that THIS was written in elixir.That made me take this much more seriously!','comment',23321281,'cultofmetatron',23319901,'[23321320]',NULL,'2020-05-27 08:09:36','2020-05-31 09:36:41'),(841,248,'Congrats, the project looks solid.

I&#x27;ve been working on a code generator that does this. It can currently generate an entire Go REST API with CRUD operations from a PostgreSQL database. Next is to generate a React&#x2F;TypeScript UI and add auth support.The advantage a project like mine has over this is that it defines a standard API specification and you can build an APIs and UIs against that standard. Right now the only API is Go, but I&#x27;d like to build a Java one too and would be open to community submissions.Same thing goes for database dialect.

Search Twitter for &quot;burn it down&quot; (just a example phrase, but you could pick &quot;shoot the cops&quot; or any number of things) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;search?q=%22burn%20it%20down%22&amp;src=type... and you get https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Pork_Soda_187&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266287249261424641\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;katie80980282&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266287106147508231\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hengebeat&#x2F;status&#x2F;1266286823480782852and these are all in the last 5 minutes. Selective enforcement doesn&#x27;t put Twitter in a good light and doesn&#x27;t seem like something that is in the best interest of their company. Also it is a bad look that their head of site integrity was saying vile stuff about the other half of America.I really dislike Trump and will definitely vote against him.

The piece unfortunately fails to make the other most important top-level comment: that all COVID-19 patients should have their D levels tested and more data on D &amp; COVID-19 severity should be published urgently (possibly based on records that already exist). And all clinical trials for COVID-19 should be testing D levels as well.Overall, this piece is not emphatic enough that vitamin D may significantly help during this COVID-19 crisis.Several important responses to some of the top material in this piece:The NYT article dismissing Holick is terrible and not worthy of being linked at the top of this piece. I won&#x27;t go into the point-by-point criticisms of this article, but it&#x27;s not worthy of a piece that is supposed to be weighing evidence.The bullet point claiming the COVID-19 association could still be a fluke does not adequately acknowledge the causal aspects of the evidence: Many RCTs on D supplementation helping viral&#x2F;respiratory infections (Martineau et al BMJ 2017), D causally affecting rate of aging in roundworms, causal inference model overwhelming supporting D&#x27;s role as causal, studies on the correlation correcting for age, sex, comorbidities, and reverse causality, and causal mechanistic biological arguments. Some portion of the strength of the correlation seen in the 1000+ patient cases published in preprint studies so far may be due to other causal factors, but the causal evidence so far makes it very unlikely for the full extent of the large effect size seen to all be a fluke.The piece wrote: &quot;A healthy full body exposure to sunlight can generate 25000 IU of vitamin D in one sitting, without getting burned. 2000-4000 IU daily of D3 supplements will also work.&quot;\nNo. People wrongly believing that some sun gives them enough is probably one of the causes of widespread deficiency. From my review, in the &quot;Practical considerations for avoiding D levels that are too low&quot; section:\nThere are several studies showing that even a lot of sun exposure leaves many people with insufficient D levels. For one list of studies see Tsiaras &amp; Weinstock, “Factors influencing vitamin D status” Acta dermato-venereologica, 2011: “Studies in Hawaii (97), South Florida (98), Southern Arizona (99), Brazil (100), rural India (101) and Queensland, Australia (102) found that significant proportions of the study populations had low vitamin D levels despite abundant sun exposure.” For example, in the Hawaiian study, 51% of the 93 young, non-obese adults had D&lt;30ng&#x2F;ml despite 29hr&#x2F;week (&gt;4hr&#x2F;day) in the sun at latitude 21 degrees. The variability in both seasonal sun intensity and daily hours of exposure for any given individual provide yet another reason that testing blood levels would be helpful. These studies show that even those who seem to get a lot of sun exposure should probably supplement if not testing to ensure adequacy.Also, the bullet point summary in this piece fails to point out the history of the RDA being set too low by statistical mistake. (Which I&#x27;ve updated my review to include. The story is crazy---the original data used to set the RDA would have resulting in 8000 IU&#x2F;day if it had been analyzed correctly.)','comment',23355742,'kpfleger',23349962,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-29 19:27:03','2020-05-31 09:41:51'),(1044,251,'FYI also, researchers are suggesting that the Lancet HCQ study everyone (and the WHO) references nowadays is fake: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;may&#x2F;29&#x2F;covid-19-surgi....

If you do this well, you will have high revenue and rapid revenue growth, because lots of people are buying your product. You will not, however, get rich, because you’ll be spending more money making the product than you get from your customers. Your revenue will be high but your net income will be negative; it will cost you money to run this business.&gt; But then you will go to investors, and you will say “look, I have a company with rapidly growing revenue, that’s worth something, you should pay me for a share of my company.” And they will agree—“we love rapid revenue growth,” they will say—and you will sell stock in the company for hundreds of millions of dollars.

The model achieves competitive results on many NLP tasks and benchmarks WITHOUT FINETUNING. Let me repeat that: there is no finetuning. There is only unsupervised (i.e., autoregressive) pretraining. For each downstream NLP task or benchmark, the pretrained model is given text instructions, and possibly sample text with questions and answers. The NLP tasks on which the model was tested include translation, question-answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, using novel words in sentences, and performing 3-digit arithmetic.3. The model is tested only in a ZERO-SHOT or FEW-SHOT setting. In other words, for each NLP task, the pretrained model is given text instructions with zero examples, or text instructions with a small number of examples (typically 10 to 100).

But instead there seems to be this extremely strong desire to see certain ineffable qualities in neural networks. Like, it&#x27;s a language model. It does language modeling.

Beyond that, what does it mean to say it &quot;is&quot; a few-shot learner?On one hand, it&#x27;s literally the same claim in a strict sense. On the other hand, it implies something much broader and more sweeping, that language modeling &#x2F; unsupervised learning as a task over long contexts inherently implies meta-learning ability — which is a statement that is very difficult to properly formulate, let alone back up.

Is this research really worth what it costs, when waiting a year makes it that much more efficient?[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;data-center&#x2F;v100&#x2F;[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.calculateme.com&#x2F;energy&#x2F;gallons-of-gas&#x2F;to-joules&#x2F;....[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Engine_efficiency#Gasoline_(pe...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.nvidia.com&#x2F;nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-de...','comment',23352338,'6gvONxR4sf7o',23345379,'[23359942, 23352805, 23353953]',NULL,'2020-05-29 14:50:06','2020-05-31 09:42:38'),(1076,254,'Does it have a latent personality?

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3&#x27;s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.','comment',23345454,'baylearn',23345379,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-28 23:47:58','2020-05-31 09:42:42'),(1079,254,'Check out the poetry it generated in Figure F.1 (especially poem 4).

Here is what I&#x27;ve learned over the years:People keep repeating that you should work on ideas that solve problems that you have yourself. Now given some time on your own, it&#x27;s natural to start looking at your problems and seeing how to solve them for yourself and potentially others and make a profit along the way. If you want a sinister spin on this, nothing sells better than fear or hope.But this is HN and as far as tech people go, our instinct is to solve problems that are given to us. And often when we have problems on our own, we come up with a solution and don&#x27;t really think about it twice. I was recently talking with someone about a project they had at their work and how their company paid something like 3 million euros to another company to build a &quot;platform&quot; for them. And given that their company isn&#x27;t that large or doesn&#x27;t have that many users (say 40k&#x2F;month tops), that raised my eyebrow a bit. So I asked them to show me what that &quot;platform&quot; was. Long story-short, a website with a username and password registration, email verification, paypal subscription, which allows you to download a list of PDF&#x27;s.To a developer the whole concept sounds like a joke - anyone with a few months of experience can mash that up in two weeks. &quot;Oh but we have so many users and traffic, it&#x27;s not that simple.&quot;Bruh... 40k users&#x2F;month, 100 pdf&#x27;s, ~2mb each is something a raspberry pi can serve without any issues.The truth is, most tech people are very much detached from reality(granted that the mass of people is the reality and not the other way around). We try to fix problems which we really don&#x27;t have ourselves and we over-engineer the crap out of them. And commonly this is the result of the so called &quot;idea generation&quot;. It&#x27;s easy to create a startup that solves a niche problem. But we often fail to acknowledge how tiny these niches really are. It&#x27;s easier to sell something that costs 10000 euros to 10 people and make 100k as opposed to selling something for 5 euros to 20000 people.The truth is, most people create 5 euro products which have a potential audience of 10 people, hence the reason why they make 50 euros as opposed to 100k. You can scroll through PH for days and keep repeating &quot;omg, who needs this?!?!?&quot;I know I have. And truthfully I doubt many people have hit the 50 euro mark, not to mention the 100k.But people make that mistake all the time. We are surrounded by people who will hook up an led to an arduino which will blink when someone mentions them on slack while they are watching a movie, while ordinary people are looking at a website which has payments and they think that&#x27;s quantum physics. Tech people and ordinary people live in parallel universes at this point. The ideas we come up with are solutions to problems no one has. That&#x27;s the reason why SaaS is proving to be a lot more successful strategy than B2C.My take on this is that every time you come up with an idea, don&#x27;t bother sharing it with your tech friends first. In most cases you will get a 50-50 positive-negative response. Find people who are completely detached from your world and have no idea what the difference between a USB and RJ45 is.1. Can you explain your idea in 4 sentences or less?2. Do they understand it?3. Do they have that problem?3a(if Y on 3). Do they have a working solution, even if it takes 3 times the effort?If the answers to those are:1. No2. No3. No3a. YesThen don&#x27;t bother.

Okay:  Setup a software as a service Web site to solve quickly all  traveling salesman problems with fewer than, say, 1 million cities, and everything equivalent in computational complexity to them.First difficulty:  To write the server side software, basically are asking for an algorithm that shows that P = NP, and now we have had some decades to conclude that so far no one knows how to do that (with a von Neumann computer, but maybe could get a solution using a quantum computer).Well, for positive integer n &lt;= 1 million, consider the traveling salesman problem on n cities.  Without loss of generality, assume that n is a prime number (with factors only 1 and n).  Then embed this problem in ..., and notice that ..., and then apply ..., exploiting special case ...!  Right!!!Lesson 1:  This idea was super easy to find!Lesson 2:  What it takes to make this idea work is something new, and, if we get a solution, that would contradict the observation that there are no good new ideas because all the good ideas were thought of long ago.Lesson 3:  Finding an algorithm that shows that P = NP is challenging, but with that algorithm would have one heck of a strong technological barrier to entry and a contradiction to the claim that it is easy to copy a startup!My real point:  Have two lists.  List A has the problems that plenty of people would pay big bucks to have solved.  List B has the tools for solving problems.  Pick a pair from lists A and B where the tool from B solves the problem from A.Next, if there is no suitable tool in list B, then do some research and find one.  If can&#x27;t find a tool for the problem from A, then pick another problem from A and try again to do the research to find the needed tool.The research need not be as challenging as proving that P = NP.  But broadly one way to find &quot;good ideas&quot; is do some research that yields a tool that enables solving a problem from list A that has been sitting there for a long time unsolved due to the lack of a suitable tool from list B.That is, one way to find a &quot;good idea&quot; is to do some research.If we are restricting to having von Neumann computers do the data manipulations, then we can notice that the manipulations are necessarily mathematically something so that an enabling tool and the research are about forced to be in applied math.It might also be sufficient to use some of the math on the shelves of the research libraries, math that so far has been neglected by the information startup culture.Possible psychological issue:  It may be that we frequently see good problems to solve but right away, within a few seconds, implicitly, maybe even unconsciously, reject solving the problem as a startup idea because we don&#x27;t see a suitable tool for a solution.  Well, then, slow down a little on the rejection step and consider some research or just what is already in the research libraries.

I am very thankful for the feedback so far, this post is the result of the comments we received last time.Many comments suggested that we implement compensated summation (aka Kahan) as the naive method could produce inaccurate and unreliable results. This is why we spent some time integrating kahan and Neumaier summation algorithms. This post summarises a few things we learned along this journey.We thought Kahan would badly affect the performance since it uses 4x as many operations as the naive approach. However, some comments also suggested we could use prefetch and co-routines to pull the data from RAM to cache in parallel with other CPU instructions. We got phenomenal results thanks to these suggestions, with Kahan sums nearly as fast as the naive approach.A lot of you also asked if we could compare this with Clickhouse. As they implement Kahan summation, we ran a quick comparison. Here&#x27;s what we got for summing 1bn doubles with nulls with Kahan algo. The details of how this was done are in the post.QuestDB: 68ms Clickhouse: 139msThanks for all the feedback so far and keep it going so we can continue to improve.\nVlad','comment',23352521,'bluestreak',23352517,'[23354625]',NULL,'2020-05-29 15:04:04','2020-05-31 09:51:11'),(1349,268,'While Kahan summation is more accurate than naive summation, it still does not produce the precise result (the true sum rounded to the final precision).It is not too costly to do the summation exactly.

The crappy thing about Upwork is that once a job is posted, the heat is on to apply. The longer you let the job sit, the more likely that other freelancers will apply for it and get the work. Being early was an extreme advantage, even if you are the best.After googling around a bit, I found that Upwork had no way for user&#x27;s to get alerts  on new jobs, even though many user&#x27;s requested it. &quot;Hmmm, I thought, a market need&quot;. There were, though, countless forum posts and low-quality YouTube videos explaining how to set up alerts via IFTTT and Upwork&#x27;s RSS feeds feature. &quot;As a long time Upwork freelancer (12 years now) - short answer would be that you&#x27;re not cut for freelancer&#x27;s market. Long answer is harder to stomach, so skip next paragraph:1 - Being early is disadvantage actually. Being early means your bid gets dumped in job poster&#x27;s email along with the others. You want to be 1st (hard to be and you&#x27;ll never have the guarantee even with a fast notification) or let it sit for 24 hours.2 - Rant about not having notifications then answering yourself about using RSS. If RSS is hard for you to make it work then I&#x27;ll have to wonder about the rest of your skills as programmer. Personally I didn&#x27;t like any RSS feed apps out there so I wrote my own, customized to my needs. You could&#x27;ve done the same, instead you made a Saas out of it thinking you&#x27;ll strike gold.','comment',23347427,'unnouinceput',23343794,'[23350012]',NULL,'2020-05-29 05:58:41','2020-05-31 09:53:36'),(1450,279,'The Visual Studio Code version from the Insiders Program is now available as a native arm64 build for Windows 10.

On my Surface Pro X, I just launched both VSCode compiled for ARM64 and Sublime Text compiled for ia32. VSCode is using about 300MB+ and Sublime Text (working under built-in ia32 emulation) is using 15MB.I’m happy to have native VSCode, not only because many people rely on that but because it means that Electron, NodeJS, and node-gyp must be working for Windows on ARM in a somewhat stable manner and that will open the doors for other applications to arrive in the platform soon (I hope).I know that most readers here are not keen on anything Microsoft related, I understand that and in many cases share the sentiment and views but there might be readers that got an SPX and were waiting for this release like I was.

It would be helpful if you could add some screenshots showing how email address creation, deletion and email receipt work (please do not use GIFs, just a set of static images are enough).Tangentially on Telegram bots, one of the things I dislike with privacy on Telegram is that the user ID (an internal Telegram generated number, not to be confused with your chosen username) given to bots is static. It&#x27;s not an ID per bot and there&#x27;s no way to change the ID without deleting your Telegram account and creating it again later (I&#x27;m not sure if it changes then either). Bots can also see and save your name (as entered on the profile) on Telegram. This makes it easier for bots (or bot swarms) to track users on Telegram.

With WhatsApp this is impossible.I could lose my sim card, both phones and one laptop. But if I still have access to one client, I can login on fresh devices.This is because once you&#x27;re registered, telegram sends the OTP to the installed clients instead of SMS.One awesome stuff they do is that after a successful logon on a new device, the notification is broadcast to all logged in client apps. Deleting the notification in one device will not remove it in others.Making it harder for account takeovers to happen stealthily.Also newly logged in clients cannot terminate older sessions.CHATTINGThe ability to edit already sent text in telegram is awesome.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly clear, however, as to when to use airflow.The single best reason to use airflow is that you have some data source with a time-based axis that you want to transfer or process.  For example, you might want to ingest daily web logs into a database.  Or maybe you want weekly statistics generated on your database, etc.The next best reason to use airflow is that you have a recurring job that you want not only to happen, but to track it&#x27;s successes and failures.  For example, maybe you want to garbage-collect some files on a remote server with spotty connectivity, and you want to be emailed if it fails for more than two days in a row.Beyond those two, Airflow might be very useful, but you&#x27;ll be shoehorning your use case into Airflow&#x27;s capabilities.Airflow is basically a distributed cron daemon with support for reruns and SLAs.

To be honest, I don&#x27;t like it for a lot of reasons:1) it&#x27;s not cloud native in the sense that running this on e.g. AWS is an easy and well trodden path. Cloud is left as an exercise to the reader of the documentation and at best vaguely hinted at as a possibility. This is weird because that kind of is the whole point of this product. Sure, it has lots of things that are highly useful in the cloud (like an ECS operator or EMR operator); but the documentation is aimed at python hackers running this on their laptop; all the defaults are aimed at this as well. This is a problem because essentially all of that is wrong for a proper cloud native type environment. We&#x27;ve looked at quite a few third party repos for terraform, kubernetes, cloudformation, etc that try to fix this. Ultimately we ended up spending non trivial amounts of time on devops. Basically, this involved lots of problem solving for things that a combination of wrong, poorly documented, or misguided by default. Also, we&#x27;re not done by a long shot.2) The UX&#x2F;UI is terrible and I don&#x27;t use this word lightly. Think hudson&#x2F;jenkins, 15 years ago (and technically that&#x27;s unfair to good old Hudson because it never was this bad). It&#x27;s a fair comparison because Jenkins kind of is a drop in replacement or at least a significant overlap in feature set. And it arguably has a better ecosystem for things like plugins. Absolutely everything in Airflow requires multiple clicks. Also you&#x27;ll be doing CMD+R a lot as there is no concept of autorefresh. Lots of fiddly icons. And then there&#x27;s this obsession with graphs and this being the most important thing ever. There are two separate graph views, only one of which has useful ways of getting to the logs (which never requires less than 4-5 mouse clicks). And of course the other view is the default under most links so you have to learn to click the tiny graph icon to get to the good stuff.3) A lot of the defaults are wrong&#x2F;misguided&#x2F;annoying. Like catch up defaulting to true. There&#x27;s this weird notion of tasks (dags in airflow speak) running on a cron pattern and requiring a start date in the past. Using a dynamic date is not recommended (i.e. now would be a sane default). So typically you just pick whatever fixed time in the past. When you turn a dag on it tries to &#x27;backfill&#x27; from that date unless you set catchup to false. I don&#x27;t know in what universe that&#x27;s a sane default. Sure, I want to run this task 1000 times just because I unpaused it (everything is paused by default). There is no way to unschedule that. Did I mention the default parallism is 32. That in combination with the docker operator is a great way to instantly run out of memory (yep that happened to us).4) The UI lacks ways to group tasks like by tag or folders, etc. This gets annoying quickly.5) Dag configs as code in a weakly typed language without a good test harness leads to obvious problems. We&#x27;ve sort of gobbled together our own tests to somewhat mitigate repeated deploy screw ups.6) implementing a worker architecture in a language that is still burdened with the global interpreter lock and that has no good support for either threading or light weight threads (aka co-routines) or doing things asynchronously, leads to a lot of complexity. The celery worker is a PITA to debug.7) IMHO the python operator is a bad idea because it gives data scientists the wrong idea about, oh just install this library on every airflow host please so I can run my thingy. We use the Docker operator a lot and are switching to the ECS operator as soon as we can figure out how to run airflow in ECS (we currently have a snow flaky AMI running on ec2).8) the logging UI is terrible compared to what I would normally use for logging. Looking at logs of task runs is kind of the core business the UI has to do.9) Airflow has a DB where it keeps track of state. Any change to dags basically means this state gets stale pretty quickly. There&#x27;s no sane way to get rid of this stale data other than a lot of command-line fiddling or just running some sql scripts directly against this db. I&#x27;ve manually deleted hundreds of jobs in the last month. Also there&#x27;s no notion of having a sane default for number of execution runs to preserve. Likewise the there is built in way to clean up logs. Again, Jenkins&#x2F;Hudson had that always. I have jobs that run every 10 minutes and absolutely no need to keep months of history on that.There are more things I could list. Also, there are quite a few competing products; this is a very crowded space. I&#x27;ve given serious thought to using Spring Batch or even just firing up a Jenkins. Frankly the only reason we chose airflow is that it&#x27;s easier for data scientists who are mostly only comfortable with python. So far, I&#x27;ve been disappointed with how complex and flaky this setup is.If you go down the path of using it, think hard about which operators you are going to use and why. IMHO dockerizing tasks means that most of what Airflow does is just ensuring your dockerized tasks run. Limiting what it does is a good thing. Just because you can doesn&#x27;t mean you should in airflow. IMHO most of the operators naturally lead to your airflow installs being snow flakes.Not dockerizing means you are mixing code and orchestration. Just like installing dependencies on CI servers is not a great idea is also the reason why doing the same on an airflow system is a bad idea.','comment',23350571,'jillesvangurp',23349507,'[23353064, 23351065, 23353271]',NULL,'2020-05-29 12:51:17','2020-05-31 09:55:41'),(1505,283,'Has anyone who has used this also used SSIS?

Obsidian is going into public beta today! (We&#x27;re also on Product Hunt, come check us out!)We made Obsidian to be your long-term second brain and personal knowledge base. As you put in more notes and make more connections, the knowledge base gets more valuable, so we think it&#x27;s important that you can 100% own your data and not rely on any cloud services.We believe you second brain should work similarly to your own brain and connections are crucial in thinking. Obsidian supports [[internal links]] between your notes out of the box, and provide a powerful graph view and backlink pane to help you understand your knowledge.We also noticed how personal note-taking and knowledge management is, so we built Obsidian to be very extensible from the start, and let you put together your own workflow with plugins like daily notes and page preview as building blocks.This leads to our three fundamental values of Obsidian:1. Local-first, Markdown plain text based;\n2. Link as first-citizen.\n3. As extensible as possible.Obsidian is a powerful front-end for your knowledge, like an IDE for your notes.Learn more about Obsidian&#x27;s features: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md&#x2F;featuresRead the story of the project and the team: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md&#x2F;about','comment',23324697,'ericax',23324598,'[23327378, 23325575, 23326724, 23328399, 23325746, 23330947, 23329131, 23333006, 23334962, 23331209, 23327860, 23324977, 23333445, 23325064, 23329273, 23336275, 23350443, 23333013, 23325454, 23326562, 23333009, 23325036, 23342138, 23325450, 23325441, 23333507]',NULL,'2020-05-27 13:22:28','2020-05-31 09:57:29'),(1548,287,'As several people have pointed out, both the &quot;Personal&quot; and &quot;Catalyst&quot; licenses are intended for personal use only, making this quite an expensive product should I want to use it for work as well.

Here are my thoughts:I love that this is basically just markdown with wiki links. I&#x27;m not too concerned about Obsidian going out of business and my notes not being useful anymore. Contrast that with Notion (which is great in many other ways), where I store my data on their cloud and even though I can export to markdown not everything is actually markdown (e.g. tables) so they just put a link to their site instead.I also love that since this is locally stored, I have control of how I store my data. I have a private git repo, and just occasionally commit and push my changes.I wish it were open source, that way I could feel better about the wiki links being useless if they go out of business. It&#x27;s not a blocker for me though, since my notes are fairly straightforward and I mostly just use the links for table of contents files.The downside of being locally stored is that it isn&#x27;t cross-device capable. This limits me when I&#x27;m taking notes on my iPad. That said, I don&#x27;t take many notes on my iPad so if I need to I can just manually transfer my notes when I get back to my computer. I can understand though that this would a be a show stopper for some people.Overall, this solution works for me.

You can&#x27;t have only planets and stars curving the fabric of spacetime, it has to be the individual particles that make them up, because duh: if you split a planet in two, each half will keep half the mass and hence half the curvature.[1] You can repeat this all the way down to atoms, nucleons, and electrons. Probably photons, quarks, and neutrinos too.But that&#x27;s not how anything works in field theory, QED, etc... they just assume that there&#x27;s a locally flat background with some &quot;stuff on top&quot; that doesn&#x27;t distort the background at all. Like a function above the number line.The key insight is that whatever makes particle curve spacetime must be some inherent, fundamental aspect of their nature. Not an extra &quot;m&quot; attribute that can be anything. That&#x27;s why rest masses of all particles are consistent, their mass -- their curvature in spacetime -- is the very essence of their nature.My current best hunch is that particles are like knots or tangles in the fabric of spacetime, inherently curving it. All information is encoded as curvature, and curvature is the only thing that truly exists. In this model, black holes are regions of maximum curvature, vaguely like a ball of yarn. If you want to add one extra &quot;strand&quot; going into the ball of yarn, its cross-section has to be added to the surface area of the black hole, which is why black hole area is proportional to its matter content, not its volume.1] Not quite though! There is the gravitational binding energy. You have to put energy into a planet to split it up into separate particles, and conversely, planets release energy by the mere act of their forming. Jupiter releases more energy from its interior due to gravitational contraction that it receives from the Sun. In effect, particles are heavier separately than together.','comment',23360450,'jiggawatts',NULL,'[23361699, 23364889]',NULL,'2020-05-30 09:45:45','2020-05-31 13:22:02'),(1780,184,'Sure, one can speculate that.

Overall the bottom level is &quot;enough&quot; in theory but rising up the levels allows us to gain orders of magnitude more &quot;practicality&quot;.Sometimes by common sense we stumble upon a mid-level concept and then when we learn about the lower level explanation, we proclaim that the original phenomenon was &quot;emergent&quot;.Now it&#x27;s a great (but I think not very fruitful) philosophical debate to decide which level has how much &quot;realness&quot;, is the higher level just a convenient fiction, an illusion, a practical description and there is a lowest, rock bottom level which the universe&#x2F;God really &quot;cares about&quot;, or are all levels just as real and the whole hierarchy&#x2F;ladder is just our conception,and not only can rising up the abstraction be an artificial action, but maybe descending lower can also be a illusory&#x2F;non-natural and a result of our search for practicality and the rock bottom isn&#x27;t really that real and the universe doesn&#x27;t know to care about it.Just as in math the naive explanation is we have fundamental axioms and we derive the higher level theorems from it. But in reality what happens is we know what theorems we want (to make things interesting or empirically useful) and then look for ways to structure the axioms to give rise to the &quot;real&quot; theorems.Or, what view of a signal is more real and fundamental, the time-domain or the Fourier-domain? Both can be equally real or equally fundamental, and can give rise to equally interesting Analyse. Or perhaps not, and the time domain is what the universe cares about and has in its &quot;source code&quot; (which is probably a misplaced metaphor though) and Fourier is just for convenience...Other times when making the relations into thing (reifying them) and vice versa we don&#x27;t really move higher or lower, we stay roughly on the same level. An example is duality in graph theory (faces to nodes, nodes to faces) or in optimization (exchanging the role of variables and equations). And at the risk of sounding wooey, this is similar to the duality, non-duality ideas in Eastern philosophy, looking at the same stuff but interpreting &quot;the gaps&quot; as &quot;the things&quot; and vice versa. And then saying neither is more real, both are real and neither are, together they are real, separately they aren&#x27;t etc. Maybe the levels are not a strict hierarchy, maybe they loop back, maybe consciousness is indeed such a feedback loop across different levels (a la Hofstadter), then you get to resonances in feedback loops and if you push it far it gets quite wooey. But it&#x27;s still very differently wooey than some quantum healer fixing the resonances in your liver through the TV.','comment',23359253,'bonoboTP',NULL,'[23359284, 23360870]',NULL,'2020-05-30 05:36:47','2020-05-31 13:24:46'),(1905,205,'What did you conclude though...is there no such thing, or do you think there is but no one has figured it out, yet?','comment',23358805,'mistermann',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-30 03:47:18','2020-05-31 13:24:48'),(1906,205,'The development of quantum mechanics suggests not.

As long as they learn new things with each iteration it doesn&#x27;t matter if they blow up 5 or 50 ships. The actual material cost of these prototypes is probably in the low 6 figures. The biggest cost is the labor, but by iterating rapidly they are learning new manufacturing techniques, so if they weren&#x27;t blowing up these prototypes they would be stacking them in a field or tearing them down anyways, since the value is in the process, not the final product, at this point.Also, there are only an estimated 300 employees building Starships (although there are probably more working on engineering), so on-site labor costs are probably about a million a week. Since they can pop out a new iteration every few weeks they cost is probably only about a few million per ship. That&#x27;s a lot of money in some industries, but it&#x27;s a rounding error in rocketry. They could build dozens or even hundreds of prototypes for less than the cost of a conventional disposable rocket, like SLS.The idea that the cheapest way to build a rocket is to blow up dozens of prototypes is a bit counterintuitive, but I believe it&#x27;s the future. Organizations that move more slowly to avoid failures will fall further and further behind, since the tortoise only wins if the hare falls asleep,  which SpaceX shows no signs of doing.Civil engineers are able to use mathematical models to develop bridges because we&#x27;ve been building bridges for thousands of years, and they can build in huge safety factors.

So that&#x27;s not a good example of software causing problems for airliners.)There are two reasons why you can expect software to be more and more the cause of airliner safety issues:- software is eating the world- software is getting more complicatedThe first is a long-term trend now.  Look under the hood of any automobile from before the 80s: no computer to be found.  Look under the hood of any automobile from the past 30 years: computers abound.  The reason for this is that many problems are easier to address in software than in hardware.  Of course, you go from N hardware problems to some possibly smaller set of possibly simpler hardware problems at the cost of gaining a set of software problems -- but this trade-off usually pays off.  In some cases this trade-off enables functionality that would be infeasible to create otherwise.The second problem is also a long-term trend: CPUs, systems, operating systems, and applications have all tended to get more complex.  In embedded systems the trend has been less strongly towards ever-increasing complexity, but even in embedded systems things have gotten more complex.Whether the problem is less competence among today&#x27;s programmers is hard to establish here.  First, we need much more software, which means we need many more programmers, which means the quality of programmers you get probably does decrease, though then again, we do have more programmers overall as more people (competent and otherwise) are attracted to the industry.  But more importantly, the increase in complexity of today&#x27;s systems could very well be enough to make yesteryear&#x27;s competent programmers incompetent today -- you can&#x27;t really compare software development 40 years ago to software development today.(I object to this idea that lower-wage programmers necessarily can&#x27;t be competent, though that isn&#x27;t quite what you wrote.  It&#x27;s true that a lax process for outsourcing can mean you get less competent programmers, and it&#x27;s probably true that higher GDP&#x2F;capita correlates with availability of competent programmers.  But it doesn&#x27;t follow that there are no competent lower-wage programmers in India, say.)','comment',23356577,'cryptonector',NULL,'[23360629]',NULL,'2020-05-29 20:58:16','2020-05-31 13:36:59'),(2434,227,'Don&#x27;t underestimate the fact that there is a higher volume of software though.Many things that used to be done by analog computers or manually done by the pilot are now done in software.In addition, the Boeing MAX was a largely system design issue; the software was operating as-designed, and had it been implemented in hardware, it would have likely failed in the same manner.','comment',23355541,'aidenn0',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-29 19:05:35','2020-05-31 13:37:00'),(2435,227,'Most modern systems aim to move all &#x27;hard&#x27; bits to software.Theres no surprise that&#x27;s where most of the failures occur.','comment',23356046,'londons_explore',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-29 20:01:00','2020-05-31 13:37:02'),(2436,227,'It&#x27;s an avionics bug, so very likely the affected equipment is aftermarket.','comment',23357471,'throwanem',NULL,'[23360329]',NULL,'2020-05-29 23:03:18','2020-05-31 13:37:03'),(2437,227,'&gt;But the first time you see airplane software malfunction, that means you need to change the way the software is written and released so that the whole class of issues will not ever happen again.This is pretty good intuition but often a systemic change is not economically feasible.

To explain, in the 10 years prior to the 737-MAX problems there were 50,000,000 flights and software was not implicated in a single passenger air fatality. The average flight is ~5,000 KM which is ~4-5 hours. So, in ~250,000,000 flight-hours, there were two crashes due to software. A plane takes ~3 minutes to fall from cruising altitude, so we can model this as a downtime of 6 minutes per 250,000,000 hours which gives us an downtime of 1 in 2,500,000,000 or a 99.99999996% uptime (yes, that is 9 9s). In contrast, I think most software people would agree that AWS is high quality. The AWS SLA specifies a 99.99% uptime (1 in 10,000 downtime). So, by this metric, airplane software is 250,000x more reliable than normal high quality software.The point of this is that the standard for airplanes is almost inconceivably high compared to normal software. To think that they are incompetent or suggest that all they need to do is adopt X or Y common-sense&#x2F;best-practice is a gross misunderstanding of what is being done and what needs to be done to improve. It would be like someone trying to tell a civil engineer making a 50-story skyscraper that they really need to adopt high quality wood construction techniques from makers of doghouses.

But if you&#x27;re on the other side of the transgender debate, and feel that pronouns should be based on biology-derived gender, and don&#x27;t think trans women and biological women should be lumped into a group, then you might be banned. Put another way, Twitter has encoded political stances into their operating procedures, and there&#x27;s no escaping that even if they expressed a wish to treat their customers equally across the board.There are only two ways out. One option is that Twitter admits it is biased, that they do discriminate against certain viewpoints, and that they do exert editorial control over their platform.

One interpretation, which I think Trump is using, is that &quot;laws come last&quot;. There is a principle that says free speech should be protected and laws only come to cover the cases where the principle can be infringed. So twitter, in this interpretation, would be correct according to current law, but would stand on the wrong side with regards to a higher value of upholding the principle.However there is another interpretation which says that ability to remove someone from your private business is also an expression of free speech. And that private companies as well as individuals are free to choose who they do business with. But there is one nuance here - this is better served under another principle which is &quot;freedom of association&quot;. Freedom of association states that you can refuse to deal with anyone you don&#x27;t like. However in USA this principle recently lost its value after certain group of Christians were not allowed to refuse baking a cake for a gay couple. So it seems there are certain protections.But then there is a third thing which is that in some countries (and I am not sure here about USA) the president has the right to send a message using any media channel he sees fit, and the media channel cannot refuse. Informing and communicating with the public is one of president&#x27;s duties and refusing to send his message infringes upon it. If USA has such a law and if Twitter could be interpreted as a media platform then it could be against the law for Twitter to do what it is currently doing. Unlikely thou, as twitter has a team of lawers and likely they were consulted beforehand.&gt; Zooming all the way out I don&#x27;t see why Twitter really care about such a fightCompanies are ran by people and those people take political sides.

You want an idea to have a few passionate users rather than lots of lukewarm users, because there&#x27;s an activation energy to building a habit and if you&#x27;re only lukewarm you&#x27;re not going to get over it.  As PG put it, &quot;Sum that reaction over a whole population, and you have no users.&quot;On the other hand, you have Geoffrey Moore&#x27;s &quot;Crossing the Chasm&quot; [2].  This has the critical observation that early adopter &amp; mainstream populations are different.  About 10% of the population has an early-adopter mindset: they will try anything because it&#x27;s new and cool.  Those are the people Sam says you should be hanging out with in this article.  But your experience with them doesn&#x27;t generalize, because most people don&#x27;t think like that.  Most people are self-interested and have short attention spans: if it doesn&#x27;t deliver clear value to them with minimal hassle, they aren&#x27;t interested.The set of world-changing products really exists in the intersection of these two worldviews.  Products that had lots of passionate early adopters but failed to cross the chasm include Lisp, LiveJournal, RSS, VR (both times),  and cryptocurrency.  Products that aimed for too mainstream a market and only had lukewarm users include WebTV, grocery delivery, and smartwatches.  In between are products like the iPhone, where the PDA market had been sitting in early-adopter limbo since 1991 but technological changes finally made it practical, or YouTube, where streaming video had been in early-adopter limbo since RealAudio in 1997 (?) but cell-phone video, Flash, and easy web uploads made it practical in 2005.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;startupideas.html[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crossing_the_Chasm','comment',23344444,'nostrademons',NULL,'[23345887, 23345757, 23344637, 23349575, 23346203, 23346758]',NULL,'2020-05-28 21:39:02','2020-05-31 13:59:26'),(3303,256,'Nah, I think you&#x27;re asking a good question!

You want to be around people who have a good feel for the future, will entertain improbable plans, are optimistic, are smart in a creative way, and have a very high idea flux. These sorts of people tend to think without the constraints most people have, not have a lot of filters, and not care too much what other people think.The best ideas are fragile; most people don’t even start talking about them at all because they sound silly. Perhaps most of all, you want to be around people who don’t make you feel stupid for mentioning a bad idea, and who certainly never feel stupid for doing so themselves.--I worry that many will take away the wrong lesson, i.e. that every idea has potential, no idea is stupid.

The problem with a purely &quot;open web&quot; is that there&#x27;s no solution to those, because of bad actors. The only solution we&#x27;ve found so far are centralized organizations which can run sophisticated machine learning and hire thousands of moderators.The second is aggregation and discoverability. What good is it to publish if nobody finds you? Matching what people want to read, with the content they&#x27;ll like (and not turning it into a firehose) is a really hard problem which, again, open standards basically do nothing for.And then of course the third is monetization. There&#x27;s a lot of amazing content on, e.g. YouTube, that wouldn&#x27;t have been created if it weren&#x27;t for monetization, because it takes content creators time that they&#x27;d otherwise have to spend at a job.Now if we can create open standards that work as well as centralized solutions for all three of these... then we&#x27;re talking.','comment',23337375,'crazygringo',23334463,'[23341699, 23342229, 23340373, 23337545, 23337935, 23337658, 23337562]',NULL,'2020-05-28 12:08:11','2020-05-31 21:38:42'),(3516,295,'The author talks about the web as &quot;one of humanity&#x27;s greatest inventions.&quot; which is now in crisis:&gt; And now, we the architects of the modern web — web designers, UX designers, developers, creative directors, social media managers, data scientists, product managers, start-up people, strategists — are destroying it.The interests of tech companies, investors and web professionals have not always aligned with the best interests of end-users and so there has been a gradual erosion of the freedoms embedded in the foundations of the web itself.My favourite StarTrek moment is Captain Pike&#x27;s statement &quot;We are always in a fight for the future&quot;.

Agree with most of what&#x27;s written in the post. But I&#x27;d like to discuss one part of it:&gt; [...] the major websites of today&#x27;s web are not built for the visitor, but as means of using her.To me, here lies a key point that both the writer and many commenters here in HN seemed to miss in 2017. What&#x27;s written here is just a consequence, and the post goes on to develop it through all its length... but why did the dynamics change in that way? What&#x27;s the underlying reason for the shift?Some comments here in HN mentioned it: internet becoming a marketplace. With both its good and bad side-effects. It&#x27;s an extremely complex issue, but money does completely shape dynamics of current society, and therefore internet too, and it leaves us without spaces that aren&#x27;t conditioned by it. At small scale it doesn&#x27;t seem a big problem, or we rationalize it because everyone needs money to survive... But it really shapes the world, and we can&#x27;t simply ignore the ugly sides of it and pretend we can solve it without ever involving the discussion about money and the dynamics it generates.The &quot;magic&quot; the post talks about only needs three ingredients: human curiosity, time (to develop that curiosity), and spaces (to host those humans and their time). Human curiosity and creativity will always exist as long as we don&#x27;t go extinct. About time... well, we can satisfy our basic needs more efficiently than ever... and yet, ironically, we are using the newly freed time to create &quot;more competitive&quot; products that focus on enslaving the potential of our fellow human beings through infinite-scroll addiction, fear of missing out, instant gratification, attention grabbing and other kinds of biases and &quot;bugs&quot; in the human system. And finally spaces. Well, nothing left. If the only accessible spaces require money or work-to-generate-money, you close the circle and can&#x27;t scape the landscape and conditioning I was describing. Even if there are some spaces left, they tend to fell into oblivion against the competition. Too hard to escape, too easy to rationalize.And honestly, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any game-changer discussion about morality standards here. Morals must play a very important part in getting us to start a change (and by us I mean the kind of people that&#x27;s most directly involved in tech, like this HN crowd), but as long as we don&#x27;t try to really disrupt at least some of the dynamics generated by money-profit-survival-motivations, I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical we will be able to move the needle, because efforts will be eaten by the competition even if we never wanted to play under those rules. Let&#x27;s hope I&#x27;m mistaken and it&#x27;s easier to solve.','comment',23335386,'slx26',23334463,'[23337183]',NULL,'2020-05-28 07:44:29','2020-05-31 21:39:01'),(3527,295,'Some days, I miss telnet-ing into BBSes.','comment',23338691,'stakkur',23334463,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-28 13:49:33','2020-05-31 21:39:02'),(3528,295,'I (as an armchair philosopher, and not a very good one at that), argue that the problem is not the web, nor technology, but Complexity Vs. Convenience.In order to create the modern world, in order to create its conveniences, systems, sometimes very complex systems, must be implemented underneath, as infrastructure, to support all of that convenience.Sometimes they are &quot;systems of systems&quot;, that is, infrastructures heaped on top of other infrastructures, etc.They provide conveniences; that&#x27;s true, but they conversely create a series of corner-cases, a series of circumstances where the complexity creates additional problems, where the complexity serves to be the problem.Consider a future sci-fi scenario of robot war...What happened?  What went wrong?  Here&#x27;s what went wrong:Robots were created to serve humanity, but over many centuries, many generations, the knowledge of how they were created (and what it took to control them) was lost, as mankind became lazier and lazier, and deferred all work to the robots.The complexity of the robots (and their AI) increased, whereas the knowledge humanity possessed about them decreased.At a certain time, at a certain critical juncture, because of the increasing knowledge asymmetry, creator (humanity) and creation switched roles, and now the creation caused great problems for the creator, who had basically lost the knowledge, (&quot;lost the manual for&quot; &lt;g&gt;), how to control the creation.We see this pattern repeat in a variety of formats, in a variety of historic and present-day contexts; it includes (but is not limited to!): Technology, Religion, Law,  Governments, Social Systems, etc.Basically, all of those things were created to serve man, to serve mankind...And (depending upon where you are in history, or what your knowledge (or lack of knowledge) of them is, in the present day), some of them either will, or at least have the apparency of, the loss of control by their creator -- mankind.Frankenstein, by Mary Shelly, is an allegory of this theme, that is, of a creator that creates something for beneficial purposes, only that with enough time (and&#x2F;or loss of knowledge), the creation turns on the creator...Understood properly, here&#x27;s the reason why all societies eventually fail, and why far in mankind&#x27;s past, there may have been a high-tecnology society (Atlantis?) which was destroyed, because with all of the solutions it brought, it also brought additional problems, such that those could not be controlled, and eventually it was destroyed, or was the cause of its own destruction...The Greek myth of Sisyphus -- is also an allegory for this\nphenomena...  If the stone which he has to roll up a hill (only to watch it roll back down again! &quot;There goes the neighborhood!&quot; &lt;g&gt;) represents society, then he is fated to roll it up the hill to its pinacle -- only to watch it roll back down again... over and over and over, for eternity...So, Complexity Vs.

But if you make Dijkstra a class, with (say) a function to iterate through nodes, it lets you do several things that would be difficult with a function: (a) you can now re-use the same object for computing distances to multiple vertices, which allows incremental search, (b) you can now fork&#x2F;copy the object and continue searching on different extensions of the original graph, (c) you can now save &amp; restore the searcher state to pause the search &amp; continue it later, (d) you can do multiple searches across one or more graphs in lockstep.

In recent years, I&#x27;ve come to love functions.  But they are both tools that have cases of appropriateness.However, I think a lot of people are looking at classes the wrong way.In this thread, I&#x27;m hearing that classes should encapsulate functionality.  While this is an aspect of classes, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the main use case of a class.A class should represent a type of state.  That is, if you create an instance of a state, it should only support the attributes and default properties that are defined for it.  This is mainly for shorthand(there&#x27;s usually a syntax to build instances of classes) and for clear documentation.  At a lower level, the availability of a class construct makes it possible for AST parsing to do interesting things to your OO code, although I don&#x27;t know how common that is outside of JavaScript.  If JavaScript didn&#x27;t support class syntax, it&#x27;d probably be more difficult to implement things like decorators, both in terms of the Babel plugins that support it as well as future native syntax support.  But I digress.The way I see it, a class should be responsible for holding a mostly fixed set of attributes, setting defaults for those attributes, and have properties that compute off other properties.What doesn&#x27;t belong in a class are methods that do complex things with other objects and class instances.  If your method does something complicated that affects outside state, it&#x27;s time to extract it to a function that takes a context argument.  This makes it easy to test your function without necessarily having to meet all the requirements of the classes you&#x27;d be using with it, and it makes the code more flexible because you can use it for other contexts besides a single class. (I know that you can use inheritance and composition to kind of do the same thing, but I think this sucks because inheritance introduces problems and composition just adds more code than just importing a function where you actually need to use it.)More concisely, a class shouldn&#x27;t be looked at as a module, or a set of related functions that do complex things, especially when not all of those functions rely on a state.  That&#x27;s the job of an actual module construct in the language.  Classes have a specific job, which is to build an instance of a type.  If your class has a lot of functionality that&#x27;s not totally dependent on the class instance itself, it doesn&#x27;t belong there in my opinion.

Say a plate breaks in your kitchen.  What happened? Obviously some kind of an object derived from a circle and and and some sort of factory? And, uh.  Josh you mentioned broken plates.  So, as far as a broken plate, I think we can address this by adding some methods for how many pieces the plate is currently in and which broken piece we&#x27;re talking about then we can specify each broken piece as a simple polygon from the origin of the virtual object, that being the theoretical still-intact plate as manufactured.  We can also specify each plate in terms of the deviations from the platonic ideal plate as specified in the CAD designs.  So let&#x27;s change all the signatures to refer to EITHER 1 whole piece, being the whole plate, or the first broken piece, second broken piece and so on, which can all end up in different places in the world.  Ultimately this will cover just about everything except if someone makes an artisanal plate by gluing together previously broken plates, where they&#x27;re not from the same plate.  That will make garbage collection difficult as the artisanal factory might leak memory if it doesn&#x27;t use every piece.  The solution is to simply do manual garbage collection where we replace each derived plate that is made up of broken plates, with a new plate that is pre-broken, and we just have to set what pieces it is made of, and then the original pieces can be freed.  So actually the base case does need to know whether it is considered &quot;whole&quot; despite being made up of broken pieces, and then it can have virtual pieces that comprise it but know that they have to move and be together as one.  This basically captures the plate abstraction pretty well, as long as you remember that we decided that for the dinner function we decided to set a plate, rather than set a table, so you just do the glass.set() the fork.set() and plate.set() so on, and then you can check that it&#x27;s set, whereas the table they&#x27;re set on might have unrelated items such as a candle, that isn&#x27;t really considered set or not.Javascript: how about we all just use paper plates. do whatever you want with them.Programmer: also works! Obviously we&#x27;ll automatically update the DOM tree whenever the server thinks anything&#x27;s changed, but that&#x27;s just common sense.Javascript: ...also feel free to pour soda in them, paper plates are cups too.Typescript: hold it!

The song lasts about 3 minutes, which means the song was streamed for 250k hours around the world. Spotify streams an average of 234 million hours per day, though, which means the number one song represents about 0.1% of the total. We have an unprecedented level of access to all sorts of different genres of music, so the number one song is barely relevant in determining this generation&#x27;s taste in music. Consider this idea: if 99.9% of the population is listening to classical music, but are all listening to different pieces it&#x27;s possible that none of the songs they are listening to would show up as number one,  since there are many thousands of classical pieces. The number one song is determined by a small percentage of people (maybe even a fraction of a percent) that care about listening to whatever is most popular at the moment.

Even by 1996 while commerce and marketing may have existed, e.g., Amazon founded in 1995, its place was in the background.  As I rememember the early web, the foreground, the &quot;starting point&quot; or &quot;portal&quot;, was something like Yahoo!  You had to pick a topic (direction) that you wanted to go in.  For example, if you were after music, you might end up browsing the Internet Underground Music Archive.  The &quot;front page&quot; of the portal was predominantly non-commercial, mostly generic headings for topics.  If you wanted to search out something commercial, no doubt you could but the initial starting point was intellectual curiosity.  This is IMO what has been lost over time with regard to web use: intellectual curiosity and the ability to actually satisfy it.

It is full of low quality mainstream &quot;news&quot;.  There is zero attention to intellectual curiosity.  Nothing to see here, folks, but here is the latest news.

I have a bookmark workaround for that but honestly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever worked.Only recently did I discover a workaround for this: on Safari you can force touch to bring up a preview of the original site then click on it to bring that up.If this change breaks that functionality then something has to change. That could be by using a browser to pretend to be a desktop browser or it could be DDG. I&#x27;m not sure yet.Why do I, as a user, not have the ability to opt out of this horrible broken mess?I&#x27;m all for having Web pages that render fast. I really hope for Google&#x27;s sake that rendering speed alone is what affects ranking and there isn&#x27;t some boost for AMP directly because that has anticompetitive written all over it. It would be forcing sites to adopt AMP or suffer downranking (to be fair, companies are typically terrible at designing fast-rendering websites).So if if DDG gets me out of AMP and I can somehow set it so I get Google search results by default (instead of Bing) without using !g on every search then honestly at this point, I&#x27;m in.','comment',23331974,'cletus',23322730,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-27 22:36:35','2020-05-31 21:56:35'),(4179,332,'Started using DuckDuckGo just to avoid AMP, the search results aren’t as good, but at least the results are usable.','comment',23324010,'alextheparrot',23322730,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-27 12:39:08','2020-05-31 21:56:37'),(4180,332,'I Googled &quot;how to turn off amp results&quot; and the top article is a 2017 article[1] that lists some workarounds, such as using duckduckgo or installing DeAMPify, &quot;an Android app that lets you bypass AMP links so you can always load the original link.&quot;  As far as a first-party way to disable it, the article says:&gt;&quot;Late last year [2016], Google said that it’s working to let users disable AMP in Google search, but there doesn’t seem to be any official kill switch yet.

You can download an AMP document, render it, attach it to an email to a friend, etc., without having to log in or get tracked.

In 2013, county commissioners established a corporation “to assist in the promotion and development of a spaceport project” in Cameron County. Under Texas law, the corporation has the authority to exercise the same right that lets governments take over private property and compensate its owners. When we met, Treviño, the county judge, told me that while he sympathizes with the residents, the use of eminent domain in Boca Chica Village is “probably a distinct possibility.” The law is on SpaceX’s side. A 2005 Supreme Court ruling expanded the definition of public use, the legal justification for eminent domain, to include economic development, and since then, states have taken advantage of that leeway: Texas, for instance, claimed dozens of homes to make room for a new stadium for the Dallas Cowboys. “That is something, unfortunately, that happens way more than it should,” Renée Flaherty, an attorney at the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit law firm in Washington, D.C., told me.&gt; Flaherty first heard about Boca Chica in the fall. “Those people were already there and [SpaceX] brought a nuisance to them, and now it’s escalated to the point where the nuisance is so severe that they’re telling them that they have to leave their own property,” said Flaherty, a Texas native herself. If the county moves ahead with legal proceedings, she believes that the remaining residents would have a case for eminent-domain abuse.- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;space-x-...If SpaceX wants to blow up rockets, they should be able to do so in a depopulated area that doesn&#x27;t have species that are uniquely sensitive to explosions. There are at least fifty species of avifauna that exist nowhere else in the contiguous United States, it is an absolutely unique habitat for these birds as well as sea turtles that had been left unexploited and open to nature until SpaceX moved its operations, seeking a site closest to the the equator within CONUS.I was initially skeptical of the importance of this site, but when the FAA initially granted them permission for this site, it assumed that such testing would not occur. SpaceX has expanded beyond this remit and is conducting extensive testing close to the habitat of several endangered species.&gt; Caught in the middle of this debate are the managers of the wildlife refuge, who, as public officials, may find themselves in the unenviable position of putting the brakes on a deal that the governor’s office and local politicians hope will be sealed sometime this summer. “We are here to manage the refuge for the wildlife,” explains Robert Jess, a project leader at the refuge. This swath of the Valley is home to a variety of animals, such as the Kemp’s ridley sea turtle, the aplomado falcon, and the piping plover, that are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act. The refuge scientists must balance their criticism of SpaceX with their obligations to their agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which asserts that, despite increased traffic, high fences, bright lights, and possible fuel spills, the launchpad is likely to pose no persistent threat to endangered species.&gt; On a blustery February morning, with the surf pounding the nearby beach, Jess paces the shoulder of Highway 4 and gestures to an expanse of dunes, tidal flats, and coastal prairie, where survey stakes mark the 57 acres that Musk hopes to transform. “The footprint is small,” Jess says, “but the potential impacts are hard for us to even imagine. When it comes to the space program, we are behind the curve. Our fear is that we are missing some big questions we don’t even know to ask.”- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texasmonthly.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;the-battle-of-boca-chi...They modelled an occasional launch and a fuel spill, but they did not anticipate such constant noise pollution that the site became inhabitable for the humans as well.I intend to become an astronaut.

SpaceX&#x27;s behavior goes against these principles and against common decency and morality.-edit: A bad faith criticism against this point would be to say that there is no such site that doesn&#x27;t have some kind of wildlife on it. That is not true, there are thousands of acres of land used for grazing, farming, and ranching. As well as land that is regularly cleared for suburban development and is understood to not be a unique habitat for endangered species. SpaceX can deploy its resources to these sites.

The simplest way to do this was to prevent other nations from building navies, and this could be done by making certain that no one was motivated to build navies—or had the resources to do so. One strategy, “the carrot,” is to make sure that everyone has access to the sea without needing to build a navy. The other strategy, “the stick,” is to tie down potential enemies in land-based confrontations so that they are forced to exhaust their military dollars on troops and tanks, with little left over for navies.-- Friedman, George.

The notion seems just as absurd today as it did in the 1800s.I attended public high school in rural upstate NY in the 90s and scored a 35 on the ACT when I was 16, without preparing at all. With some amount of studying I had a 1440 on the SAT that same year (1998 or 99) and didn&#x27;t bother taking it again. I&#x27;ve always scored well on these tests, but it never translated into much acclaim or academic success. I smoked weed at lunchtime every single day my junior and senior years of high school, which was the kind of achievement that gets celebrated in those parts.

Unlike most of my friends, I went to college where I slacked my way through a 2nd rung liberal arts school with a 3.7 in subject (mathematics), graduating in 2005. By 2010 I was in a hurry to leave the miserable customer service&#x2F;QA engineer role I had worked for 3 years at Surveymonkey.com, so I took the GRE. After about a week of half-assed prep in the evening I scored a 790 math 670 verbal 6.0 writing, enough to get me a scholarship for my Masters.

Everything is too easy in public school, and bad habits are never corrected. There&#x27;s also no role-models to show smart kids that they might go somewhere in life. Upstate New York is in a permanent state of decline, there&#x27;s nothing these kids can look forward to and they have no money to go anywhere else. Depression and doubt, difficult home lives, access to all manner of drugs, child abuse etc. The best results from my high school came from a few Indian immigrant families who sent their daughters off to Harvard and the like. We still got those girls to drink and smoke weed with us though :).There was another local (ie, white) kid in high school who was really smart and smoked lots of weed and got into trouble the same way I did.

This is widely expected, probably correctly, to trigger a chain reaction, whereby one US university after the next will abandon standardized testsYou&#x27;re really missing the point of this action. Since the College Admissions scandal, it has become clear that people with deep pockets can game the SATs and ACTs by paying people with inside knowledge. The UofC doesn&#x27;t want to eliminate standardized testing, they declared they want a replacement. They are changing this because it is unfairly skewed toward people who can pay up.Trump and the corruption and anticompetitiveness that he represents is a long line of Conservatism that up-ticked during Reagan&#x27;s era. Yes, that is certainly a threat to America, and something to worry about.Conservatives want it all, and they want it concentrated in the fewest hands possible. They are the scorpion on the back of the frog which is Capitalism. Capitalism is free-enterprise, the opportunity for people to create wealth by creating things that benefit society. Conservatives want to twist the rules, to cheat the system, so that you don&#x27;t have the opportunity, so that the rules heavily favor the people who already have it. Why? Because Conservatives stand for no-change, keep the wealth in the hands of people who were born into it. And concentrate it into their hands even more.Conservatism is the opposite of what created the USA and made it special, it is the opposite of what made the USA an economic powerhouse. Conservatism is the default that most countries are governed by, since the beginning of time, across all geographies. Conservatism is the reason why innovation and brilliant creativism is sidelined. Because incumbent power brokers don&#x27;t need it, they don&#x27;t need change, they don&#x27;t need improvements. They just need all the gains to continue going to a very few, and all they need for that is the maintenance of exploitation. Occasionally throughout history Conservatism has been broken by special laws the created fairness. In Ancient Greece it was the Solonian Constitution. In Ancient Rome it was The Law Of Twelve Tables. In 1707 Britain it was Parliament which broke Royal Monopolies and led to the Industrial Revolution. At the founding of the USA it was the Constitution. In all these cases, these laws of fairness drove massive levels of economic growth, of creative destruction and innovation, that changed the world.The Conservatives want to destroy that, because they want it all for themselves, no matter what the consequences. The Roman Emperors destroyed their equitable laws, and that lead to the decline of Rome. Now massive corporations, their heads, and their political stooges&#x2F;lackeys want to destroy equitable economic laws, they want to destroy antitrust legislation that prevents them from controlling it all forever. The momentum that big companies are building to destroy competition and fairness in this country is an existential threat to what makes the USA special. Citizens United.

Yes, we are more isolated, and perhaps concerned for the safety of ourselves or our loved ones, or even for some abstract concept of community or society, but depression is characterized by anhedonia: the inability to feel pleasure. Are we all sitting around, so preoccupied by the crises of the day that we have become numb to pleasure? That doesn&#x27;t describe depression, although perhaps anxiety. I would describe depression as the loss of most strong feelings, not only pleasurable ones, and that is why death becomes so alluring: fear of death has been numbed as well.No, an existential crisis is rooted in the meaning, or lack thereof, we are able to ascribe to our lives. And the pandemic has in many ways restricted our connections to those sources of meaning. Whatever stories we were telling ourselves about our life&#x27;s purpose, the plotlines we imagined for ourselves, have been disrupted. The student has had their university all but taken from them. They cannot experience it in quite the same tangible way as they once did. The same is true for the worker who derives his meaning from labor.

This strongly resonates with me. I believe America&#x27;s consumer culture undermines this need. Many work &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; only to be able to afford to consume things — the work itself is not for anything more meaningful than a paycheck. Mass manufacturing lets us care of most of our material needs ourselves so there is less culture around caring for each other than there used to be. There are an infinite number of &quot;experiences&quot; available, but most are simply consuming a thing created by someone else and endlessly reproduced. There is nothing particularly enriching about watching the latest Hollywood spectacle, nearly instiguishable from the previous ten movies in the franchise.Frankl observed about his fellow prisoners that people could survive anything if they had something to live for.

Mental health disorders are drastically under reported in the US, and due to various stigmas most people are unwilling to except mental health illnesses as actual illnesses until they are prepared to harm someone.This is the number one problem most police officers deal with when engaging with the public. Many people have mental health disorders they are not aware of resulting in all manners of poor decisions and disorderly conduct. Some of these disorders are severe and demand medication and some are exaggerated by existing medications. I recommend talking with experienced police officers and listening to some of their war stories.My sister-in-law is also a managing mental health counselor and says the number of undiagnosed mental health disorders could represent as much as 40% of the population.In my own experience I find that people hide from this by frequently changing their social situation and environment through out the day, such as driving to an office. When you are stuck at home full time with nowhere to go suddenly coping and distraction mechanisms are gone which becomes clear to the coinhabitants. I am on my fifth military deployment so I have gone through this a few times, and you can readily see the people lacking of a regular rhythm of emotional stability and stress management. You are with these people all the time as you live, socialize, and work with them. On a military deployment you can’t rely on a frequent change of scenery to hide your insanity.The most common example of excuse that people would hide behind pre-pandemic is finances. Bad financial situations are stressful, but stress is not a mental health disorder. Extreme stresses though often exacerbate pre-existing illnesses. In that regard bad finances don’t produce mental health disorders as frequently as suggested but instead exaggerate pre-existing conditions that become more clearly identifiable.The difference between stress and a mental health disorder is something called homeostasis, which is the ability of the brain to return to a state of regular emotional equilibrium following an incidence of high stress. The military refers to the cognitive process of actively maintaining homeostasis as resiliency and it’s part of our annual training. The inability to return to resume functions of prior behavior following a major stressor is likely the result of a mental health illness.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academia.edu&#x2F;4970988&#x2F;Mental_Health_DSM-V_mental_...','comment',23329867,'austincheney',23319576,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-27 18:56:16','2020-05-31 22:00:38'),(4318,339,'I strongly feel there is a link between modern foods and our gut&#x2F;brain axis that is causing a lot of this.','comment',23320537,'amriksohata',23319576,'[23320728]',NULL,'2020-05-27 05:55:11','2020-05-31 22:00:40'),(4319,339,'no paywall:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.fo&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;202...','comment',23331235,'eee_honda',23319576,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-27 21:03:14','2020-05-31 22:00:42'),(4320,339,'if you want to understand what&#x27;s going on zoom out and look at the last 200 years of civilization and society.

The topic of the news for the past two months now is that there&#x27;s a doom plague, a mask might not save you, people are violating quarantine to spread the plague, the economy is going to collapse, and Trump is making it all worse. People have lost their jobs, are being told they can&#x27;t work, that they must stay home, they must stay away from other people, they must be afraid, etc and so forth. So in light of that, it does not surprise me at all that depression and anxiety are ramping up in the adult population.Neither does the breakdown by age surprise me, with it being worst amongst 18-29 year-olds, and declining with age. I would love to see a finer breakdown in that category. Here is my hypothesis:For the youngest of adults, especially those just now entering adulthood or their professional careers, this is probably the first societal shock they&#x27;ve experienced. They did what they were supposed to according to The Plan of How The World Works. They persevered through the soul-crushing hell that is high school, and got the best grades they could, and applied for colleges, and are ready to become adults. Or maybe they didn&#x27;t get quite so good grades or dropped out and were banking on being able to support themselves with some kind of basic labor or service job. Or maybe they&#x27;ve taken out all the student loans to go to college, and are coming into what&#x27;s supposed to be the beginning of their professional career to an economy that&#x27;s about to collapse. Or if they haven&#x27;t graduated, now there&#x27;s the uncertainty if whether or nor they&#x27;ll be able to finish their degree, with there being question about when&#x2F;if campuses will open back up, or whether the online classes offered as substitutes will actually do any useful teaching. Regardless of the myriad variations available in the above, the basic situation remains the same: here they are, their life finally about to begin, and now the economy is collapsing, everyone&#x27;s dying, a fascist oompa loompa controls the government, and generally the world is over.  Well, shit. Now what?I speak somewhat hyperbolically in describing the above, of course, but I stand by my basic point: The youngest adults are beginning their adulthood in fairly bad situation. And unless they&#x27;re old enough to remember the previous societal shocks that were supposed end the world, but didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s all to easy to come near the despair event horizon or even cross it.Compare those who are a little older, or hell, a lot older. They&#x27;ve seen the Housing Crisis, War, 9&#x2F;11, the dot-com bubble, and so on and so forth. And yet, they didn&#x27;t die and are still here. Odds are, at least one of the previous crises made their life worse for a time, or messed up what was supposed to be a bright future or golden opportunity. And yet, they didn&#x27;t die, and are still here. And the older they are, odds are, the more times they&#x27;ve seen that the world was about to end, and then didn&#x27;t. And the more likely they&#x27;ve internalized the lesson that in crises like these, how well they come out of it depends largely on their attitude and how they apply themselves to getting through it. And so we see that with the older and older age groups, the anxiety and depression numbers are lower and lower.This post might sound a bit ranty, and like I am projecting, and I&#x27;d be lying if I tried to claim there weren&#x27;t threads of that woven through it. But it is not my intention for this to be just a &quot;toughen up you whippersnappers and get off my lawn!&quot; type post.

I am happy to we are slowly starting research into that.I recommend &quot;Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research&quot; by Stanislav Grof (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Realms-Human-Unconscious-Observations...) - he was one of the pioneers into psychedelic research, while it was easy and possible.\nFor many aspects, it is... humbling. It seems that visions&#x2F;senses&#x2F;experiences of cosmic unity, or unspoken dread, or going beyond the physical world is more of a common theme of LSD.However, I am torn, when it comes to its lack of skepticism. On one hand side, he hints that some aspects of extrasensory perception (e.g. clear visions of spermatozoid entering an ovum, visions of one&#x27;s ancestors, etc) can be real, without noting some typical biases (e.g. people reporting coincidences only when they happen). Same, he seems to accept a lot of Freudian stuff uncritically.\nOn the other, I am really happy he didn&#x27;t censor the stories (or himself!) and share both processed and raw experiences. The overall narration is in the tone of a curious researcher knowing that he may get answers he is not looking for.Overall, I recommend it a lot, keeping in mind that you don&#x27;t take too religiously his mentions of Freud, Jung, birth matrices and extrasensory perception too literally. But... as a lens&#x2F;perspective, that (though flawed&#x2F;simplified) can yet be fertile.','comment',23336117,'stared',23333805,'[23339192, 23338056, 23338787]',NULL,'2020-05-28 09:37:50','2020-05-31 22:04:57'),(4489,348,'&gt; Whereas higher levels of medial prefrontal cortical glutamate were associated with negatively experienced ego dissolution, lower levels in hippocampal glutamate were associated with positively experienced ego dissolution.This is interesting.

Limiting third parties&#x27; access to the user-agent is critical for a private (and secure!) web, and it makes it easy to create really legible, transparent privacy policies and adhere to them.This type of advice works really well for a single-person company, or a small organization, but I think that they don&#x27;t go far enough once your company starts to grow, and most of these things are not really &quot;encoded&quot; as truth unless they&#x27;re expressed in the &quot;contracts&quot; signed between you and the customer, i.e. the T&amp;C and Privacy Policy.For example, consider what happens in the case of a company sale or bankruptcy: if the service along with your users&#x27; accounts and whatever else is in your database get sold to an antagonistic company, can they simply amend your privacy policy and start re-selling the data? Is your privacy policy even valid in the event of an acquisition? Most privacy policies include a quite wide allowance for disclosure in the event of sales, mergers, etc.[1] Consider adding clauses to your privacy policy providing users with strong data controls if you end up in a situation like this, even if it will make those your organization less valuable in these situations. This is a very tough call to make, of course, you&#x27;re making yourself less attractive to people who can bail you out when you&#x27;re most in need of bailing, but a more equitable relationship with your users may build enough trust in your product to keep from needing to be bailed :)How do you design your systems so that they grow to be more privacy-preserving over time? Large&#x2F;&quot;global&quot; tech companies will consider this in their security threat modeling, that e.g. anyone with root can dump the database, but even companies of 20-200 employees should be considering internal attacks like this. Businesses operating in complicated regulatory environments inevitably end up with some business-person running SQL against production once a week to get a CSV to send to a regulator, what else can they (or someone with their access) do with enough time and Stack Overflow?I&#x27;m a big fan of considering and expressing privacy values (along with other values of your organization&#x27;s choice!) in the entire business lifecycle, not just in the code+infrastructure, adopting privacy by design[2] methodologies in to your product design lifecycle, for example, if you&#x27;ve already started.

Let&#x27;s indulge this, but it seems a bad design.- what&#x27;s with all those unecessary conditional blocks?- credit_amount should never be None. It&#x27;s a Balance object, put a sane default value. But ok, indulging again.So, you get down to:    user: Optional[User]   \n    can_buy_stuff = False  \n    if user and (balance := user.get_balance()): \n       can_buy_stuff = (balance.credit_amount() or 0) &gt; 0  \n\nI don&#x27;t think the solution the lib offers is superior:    can_buy_stuff: Maybe[bool] = Maybe.from_value(user).map(  \n        lambda real_user: real_user.get_balance(),\n    ).map(\n        lambda balance: balance.credit_amount(),\n    ).map(\n        lambda balance_credit: balance_credit &gt; 0,\n    )\n\nAnd that&#x27;s if we are using the rules of the README, which are not fair.If we have a well designed API, and we use a function (more testable, and hey, are we doing FP or not ?), then:    def can_buy_stuff(user: User):  \n        if (balance := user.get_balance()):\n            return balance.credit_amount() &gt; 0\n        return False\n\nChecking the user should not be part of this algo, credit_amount should be 0 if never set.

If you have sevearal lines of logic, you&#x27;d need an auxiliary helper def, and at this point it becomes as unreadable.For Results: I think returning Union[Exception, Value] (where Value is the &#x27;desired&#x27; type) and then using isinstance(result, Exception) is much cleaner.- it can be statically checked with mypy to ensure the same level of type safety as Rust would have- minimal performance impact- no extra wrapping and unwrapping in the code. You can completely ignore mypy and error handling, until you&#x27;re happy, then you harden your program by making sure it complies to mypy.- no extra dependencies, third party code dealing with your library doesn&#x27;t have to deal with your wrappers! If they don&#x27;t check for error type, when Exception is encountered, the program will most likely terminate with AttributeError, which is a desirable behaviour in such situation.- it&#x27;s much easier to compose: propagating error with a decorator is neat, until you have some more sophisticated logic, e.g. for error aggregation- the only downside is that you end up with occasional `if isinstance(result, Exception)...`.I reviewed results library specifically here [0] and elaborate on different error handling techniques in Python, including the approach I described.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;mypy-error-handling.html#container','comment',23340181,'karlicoss',23336458,'[23340564]',NULL,'2020-05-28 15:46:39','2020-05-31 22:06:04'),(4519,353,'I&#x27;m a big fan of functional programming but this documentation is kind of funny, unintentionally.

But it makes the Python code look super complicated.It overloads map() with a lambda function, to compose function pipelining.Then, it introduces flow() as the new pipelining tool. But you have to use bind() on the last function call to return the value.Interesting concepts, but unless Python incorporates this as a standard feature, then this will remain a fringe idea.

They have everything and a lot of the teams I worked with just couldn&#x27;t use the stuff so the licenses sit on shelves burning cash. They renewed software we migrated away from, just in case... for auditing purposes. WTF?They always had a crazy security protocol for why they cant do something too. I get it, defense is important.

The fact that Boeing benefits accumulate based on time employed and not duration of employment is a nod to this.They have a reputation for building a &#x27;company within the company&#x27; for new plane models, which basically means there&#x27;s a lot of vertical integration that goes on, and you will know a great deal about one airplane but maybe not much about any of the others.  At the height of each cycle they have far more people than they can sustain. They seem like a huge company but they&#x27;re market cap isn&#x27;t that high. Yes, they have a bigger market cap than Detroit, but it&#x27;s also been over 10 years since Apple had enough money its war chest to buy Boeing for cash.So when a plane hits pre-production they start to get an itchy trigger finger. They get rid of the idiots and the non-essential people, and the non-essential people can hop onto the next thing in a couple of years.There&#x27;s a graph in this article that illustrates:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;boeing-aerospace&#x2F;in-go...They hired like mad for the 787, then did a round of R &amp; D layoffs a while after the first flight.

Meanwhile all of those people on the 737-Max are probably furloughed, or retraining on another assembly line, and there would not be an infinite supply of those even without Covid.It might be more noteworthy to look at how many people haven&#x27;t been laid off in a lockdown situation. A long time ago, the powers that be in Washington state looked at traffic patterns around Puget Sound and realized that Boeing commuters were a large percentage of this traffic. Boeing has offices all over King County, but the project you work on might be at an office across town, and you might pass several offices on your way to work.So they made a tax deal with Boeing to divert traffic rather than building more roads. My understanding is that as part of that Boeing allowed people to work from other branch offices, and while working from home wasn&#x27;t encouraged, some bosses would let you get away with 1 day a week telecommuting. And I&#x27;m not sure when 4x10 and 9x9 schedules (four day workweek, 10 hours a day, or 9 day fortnight, 9 hours a day) came in, but those helped too.Conference call software de rigeur, and whole disk encryption since before it was cool.

But as the conversation here seems to be mostly about the latter…)What a lot of people don&#x27;t realize about LaTeX is that much of its awkwardness comes from it being a product of two very strong personalities (both Turing Award winners for unrelated work!) pulling it in two opposing directions:• Donald Knuth, who designed TeX as a tool for typesetting primarily, allowing a meticulous author complete control over the appearance of his pages, and attempting to capture in a program (or at least making possible) the highest standards of typography developed over the centuries since the invention of printing.(†)• Leslie Lamport, who wrote LaTeX as a macro package running in TeX, trying to hide complexity from the author and making things as convenient as possible, out of a (probably correct) belief that authors should not care about the appearance and instead only focus on the content! (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lamport.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;document-production.p...)The result is that with LaTeX, things look “easy” superficially, but everything is implemented in TeX macros (never intended as a full-fledged programming language), so things break in mysterious ways. Not to mention the additional layers of complexity from zillions of users writing their own &quot;packages&quot; for everything. The error messages don&#x27;t make sense to users because they often come from the bowels of TeX, and I suspect that many users even just ignore(!) warnings about overfull&#x2F;underfull boxes.Conversely, if you look at one of Knuth&#x27;s own documents written in plain TeX, everything is startlingly simple: for example there is no automatic equation numbering or cross-references; for Equation 5 you just write &quot;5&quot; in the equation and refer to it as &quot;(5)&quot; later, none of that stuff with &quot;\\eqref{eq:foo}&quot; or whatever. If macros are used, they tend to be custom for the document, rather than elaborate general-purpose ones. Consider giving plain TeX a try (a great book is A Beginner&#x27;s Book of TeX by Seroul and Levy); everything makes sense, you feel in power, all the error messages are clear (often the same error messages! but now they apply to something you actually wrote&#x2F;intended), and if nothing else, you&#x27;ll end up with an appreciation of what LaTeX is&#x2F;does.This comment is turning into a repetition of my same tiresome comments on other sites (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cstheory.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;40282, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;398372, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;386592, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;384881, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;518802 etc.) so I&#x27;ll stop here I guess :-)----(†): good paragraphs, avoiding widows and orphans and hyphenation on consecutive lines and loose&#x2F;tight lines adjacent to each other, all of that. By far the longest chapter in The TeXbook, the manual on how to use TeX, is called “Fine Points of Mathematics Typing” and teaches the careful reader about aspects of typography that TeX does not handle automatically — and this is not even counting such advice in other chapters such as ties for avoiding line breaks in “psychologically bad” places. See for example http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtznet.nl&#x2F;zink&#x2F;comparison.pdf (linked from http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtznet.nl&#x2F;zink&#x2F;latex.php?lang=en) comparing plain-text paragraphs in Word and InDesign and TeX.

Rather than tell Twitter they’re out of place, I actually think they did the right thing, provided they’re willing to do it _more_, to shift towards having this performed by a group with some transparency around it, and to reference sources when they do so.Seeing politicians I can’t stand called out in public for lying is deeply satisfying, but won’t change my mind about anything.

The veracity of twitter’s fact checking. This absolutely does not matter, since Twitter may host or refuse to host whatever they want on their own website, including incorrect fact checks if that’s how they get their jollies (not that there’s any evidence that their fact checks have been incorrect so far, because there isn’t). On the other hand, Trump doesn’t have the same right, because he doesn’t own Twitter.com2. Hate speech, and whether it is ever justified. Again, this doesn’t matter. Twitter has the right to remove (or visibly flag as the case may be) any post they want on their website, for any reason they want. They might do so because a post is hate speech, but they’d be just as firmly within their rights to do so for any other reason.I think all of the confusion in these comments exists because the law is very simple, but many folks here don’t like the conclusion:1. Twitter may fact check, flag, or remove the posts of Trump or any other user completely at their discretion, even if their fact checking turns out to be incorrect. Nothing about this violates Trump’s first amendment rights in any way.2. I had hoped this was obvious, but in case it’s unclear to you, Trump and the US government absolutely do not have the power to shut down or punish Twitter in any way just because they don’t like the way that Twitter has fact checked Trump’s posts. This would in fact (obviously) violate Twitter’s first amendment rights.Finally, there is no legal distinction between a “platform” and a “publisher” that in any way restricts the control that a business has over their own website.

It is in exactly the right place.The PoTUS is threatening to shut down elections in November: he seems to be doing everything in his power to have a national emergency then when people can&#x27;t vote, to shut down post offices, and to ban voting by mail. Any other problems with the PoTUS, we should address in the ballot box and through citizen activism (not through corporate activism). But when the PoTUS tries to shut down the ballot box or shut down citizen activism, that&#x27;s different.I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s likely to be successful, but I didn&#x27;t think coronavirus would hit us this hard either. In January, it was a manageable billion-dollar problem. We did nothing. Now, it&#x27;s a multi-trillion dollar problem. Right now, Trump trying to cancel the election is a manageable problem too; by his personality, if he doesn&#x27;t get traction, we&#x27;re done. He&#x27;ll move on. But if he does get traction, we&#x27;ll have a completely different scale of problem on our hands.','comment',23322877,'wegs',23322112,'[23322988, 23322954, 23323005]',NULL,'2020-05-27 11:31:50','2020-05-31 22:17:53'),(5062,382,'&gt;Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voicesNot wrong tho especially if you just look at the mainstream media','comment',23322376,'haunter',23322112,'[23322452, 23322443, 23322644, 23322552]',NULL,'2020-05-27 10:50:46','2020-05-31 22:17:55'),(5063,382,'The hypocrisy of the Pro-Business Republican party is really astounding.

It would behoove social media companies to abide by it.- Rather than resort to censorship, social media companies can offer users tools that block unwanted content, including content that could be hurtful or offensive.- Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms have become the new public square. Rather than resorting to corporate speech policies, these companies should promote free speech principles in the U.S. and abroad.- Social media companies are global. The U.S. Constitution is based on American values and, therefore, should not be used to regulate international platforms.- The spread of hateful digital content dilutes meaningful discourse and, in some cases, causes emotional and physical harm. Social media companies have a duty to offer safe, welcoming platforms for users.From election interference to “fake news,” nefarious actors are using social media to undermine democracies and deepen partisan divides.

If instead there is a single company that decides who gets to say what on their platform, and network effects build a castle wall, regulations should force a change (such as opening the protocol) to make alternatives viable.','comment',23342562,'SiVal',23342161,'[23343968]',NULL,'2020-05-28 19:01:14','2020-05-31 22:18:28'),(5092,383,'How can they comply with &quot;EARN IT&quot; if they can&#x27;t moderate and censor?','comment',23342595,'badrabbit',23342161,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-28 19:03:56','2020-05-31 22:18:29'),(5093,383,'What&#x27;s surprising is how often I encounter fellow Americans mistakenly asserting the first amendment extends beyond government and into the private sector.It&#x27;s like they&#x27;ve never even been to a movie theater where they need to shut the hell up or leave.And here we have a US president signing an executive order in response to being moderated on a web site after years of arguably excessive tolerance of his b.s.I&#x27;m not sure how much more embarrassed I can get for my country.','comment',23342494,'pengaru',23342161,'[23344428, 23344317, 23344216, 23343182, 23343017, 23345158, 23345445, 23346389, 23343875, 23344032, 23342788, 23344333, 23345476, 23344914, 23345325, 23342747, 23342550, 23343930, 23344701, 23345028, 23344279]',NULL,'2020-05-28 18:56:57','2020-05-31 22:18:31'),(5094,383,'Does that mean we can sue Fox entertainment fake news network?','comment',23342426,'gulli1010',23342161,'[23342504]',NULL,'2020-05-28 18:52:15','2020-05-31 22:18:33'),(5095,383,'It seems like the fundamental question is: are services like Twitter and Facebook basically utilities (like ISPs) or are they basically editorial (like newspapers).That is, there are some private companies, like ISPs, that are seen as part of the basic plumbing of the internet, and which are generally not allowed to editorialize their content (for example, through net neutrality rules).

If the research is external to the agency, they must also justify the selection of research used in drafting the rulemaking.Once the proposed rule is published in the federal register, there is a comment period of at least 60 days or up to 180 days (depending on the complexity of the rule).The administration must then spend time reviewing the comments.

But I think it&#x27;s high time, the likes of Twitter, Facebook et al got a good kicking.To be fair, the problem is not with the sites themselves. They are private companies and [within the law] can do whatever the hell they like with regard to who can use their platforms and what they can say while doing so.The problem is that these type of sites [and especially Twitter] have been elevated by the rest of the world and transformed from being outlets for vacuous chatter into being the official conduit for &#x27;news&#x27;, for any lazy journalist who can&#x27;t be bothered to research a story properly.Even on such esteemed organisations as the BBC and Reuters, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly common to see news articles in which the &#x27;sources&#x27; are little more than lists of what various parties said on Twitter.  And on a smaller and even local level, more and more companies are only contactable through their Twitter accounts or Facebook pages. I even got message from the UK Government&#x27;s unemployment service a few days ago, informing me that they would be announcing nee vacancies on their Twitter account, from now on.Now, as I said, that&#x27;s not Twitter or Facebook&#x27;s fault.  It&#x27;s the rest of the worlds fault for increasingly elevating them to this pseudo-official status. But it does create the situation whereby anyone who&#x27;s not on Twitter or Facebook is increasingly disenfranchised from having their viewpoint heard or from participating in the great and small issues of the day.And what if Twitter or Facebook decide to ban a user or suspend an account? That user has no recourse but to plead with the company in question to reinstate them, which is entirely arbitrary decision. There is no legal recourse, as there would be if some authority tried to remove a person&#x27;s vote or to ban them from speaking, writing or otherwise putting forward their opinions in the &#x27;real world&#x27;.As chance would have it, I&#x27;ve run into this myself.  About a year ago, I logged into my Twitter account to find that it had been suspended as had my business Twitter account --with no reason given and nothing that I had done [that I can see] to have justified this.  I never verbally attacked anyone or posted anything dodgy. I can only think my accounts were mistakenly caught up in one of Twitter&#x27;s periodic automated sweeps, after which they proudly announce they&#x27;ve removed X-million bot accounts.The only recourse is to fill in a form asking them to review the account suspension. Which, needless to say results in nothing but an autoreply, assigning you a case number.  And then... nothing.Likewise, as chance would have it, just today I logged into a Facebook page I&#x27;d set up for my business to find a message saying that had been suspended for &quot;suspicious activity&quot;.  Again, nothing I can see that i&#x27;ve done that could possibly justify that. In fact, I don&#x27;t do FB at all. So I don&#x27;t even interact with that account apart from to occasionally post links to the latest &#x27;thing&#x27; I&#x27;ve made and am selling on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve not even added any friends to my FB account, so I couldn&#x27;t have &#x27;offended&#x27; any one! In order to lift that suspension I was asked to verify my mobile phone number [OK... with great reluctance] and then upload a photograph of myself, so they can &#x27;verify&#x27; me [WTF? Am i applying for a passport to the fucking internet now?Now, I know those last few paragraphs sound like I&#x27;m just whining and crying because I can&#x27;t use Twitter or Facebook any more. I&#x27;m honestly not. I couldn&#x27;t give a flying fk about either of them. I only created accounts on both because [as I intimated above], with the state of the internet today, we&#x27;ve arrived at a point, where, for a lot of people, Twitter and Facebook ARE the internet. It&#x27;s where they talk to their friends, where they arrange their social lives, where they do their shopping, where they read their news, where they run their businesses and where they exist online. So, sometimes, you&#x27;ve just got to swallow the rising vomit and at least establish a token presence there, just so people know you exist.Anyway, given that&#x27;s the state we&#x27;re in, should all that vast mass of human commerce and interaction be dependent on the whims of a couple of monstrously rich individuals and a couple of monstrously rich corporations? It&#x27;s a toughie.On the one hand, I&#x27;m generally opposed to government interference in how people run their lives or their businesses.

The subject of Trump&#x27;s tweet was a political dispute, and while Trump certainly had false statements in his tweet, that&#x27;s basically par for the course on Twitter.This raises a bunch of questions. Why is Twitter singling out Trump for his false statements?

For example this Medium post [1] was removed based on its content. It did not contain anything inflammatory, violent, or otherwise unsavory.

Many of our members have similar stories to yours, although we are largely aimed at 50+, we hear the same from 45+ too. Sadly I don&#x27;t think this is something that will change overnight, changing societal opinions is never easy and takes persistence, which we are committed to. We are engaging with our membership base and listening to their experiences in order to better educate employers on the importance of an age-diverse workforce and how to ensure that&#x27;s happening for them. We are making an impact but as you have seen there is a long way to go!I know that doesn&#x27;t help you right now, I&#x27;m sorry.

There is a limit on how much value a developer can bring by working on assigned stories and tickets, and experience after a few years plateau (and age discrimination start to kick in), but go higher in the chain and suddenly you experience becomes very valuable.

So get the most modern version that is easy to install for you.- be comfortable with &quot;-m&quot;, the &quot;py&quot; command on windows, &quot;pip&quot; (-m, --user, install, install -r, freeze), and &quot;-m venv&quot;.- make sure you understand what the PYTHON PATH is and how it works regarding the import system- know how to configure your favorite editor to work with thoseOnce you have those basics, you can go and try whatever have you: peotry, pyenv, pew, virtualenvwrapper, pipenv and so on. It will be easy because you will have a solid understanding of where it comes from and how it plugs in into the ecosystem. You will be able to chose if they are worth it or not for you. And more importantly, when you will have to move away from them (because of work, because they don&#x27;t suit you, because they are abandonned...), you will always be able to fall back to basics.But franckly, there are so many things that you should be learning before those extras: pdb, black, pylint, zipapps... Or even concepts like generators, decorators, unpacking, etc. They all have a better value for the time you spend on them than learning a new &quot;modern&quot; stack.Not that it&#x27;s not useful to have a modern stack.

That’s why JS bundlers were created in first place. To avoid the cost of a long critical chain.Using a device from Africa (Uganda) to connect to US servers, one feels how bad an experience latency can make. More and more development is done on cloud machines or remote host, so this isn’t a rare usecase.What I do hope for is if there is a new bundler, it can use the webpack plugin ecosystem.

Someone emails, someone has a question, someone has a clarification, etc.Now if we assume same locale, that drastically changes the game since everyone can communicate at the same time even if remote. Therefore, my point#1 is, a global distributed teams that are across time zones really don&#x27;t make sense.Keeping in line with the article, let&#x27;s say a company decides to outsource all these different professions. That would mean, you&#x27;re even outsourcing management, people that need to oversee are needed to the same region. How high does one go? All the way to directors of each respective field or Vice President? Maybe we go as far as till we reach an owner for a service or product for that region. This is what happens basically today (pre-covid). Each region has a focus in a deliverable. India team is working on X, China team is working on Y, etc. So point#2, outsourcing has to happen not only for people that are executing work, but for people that are overseeing the execution as well.That finally gets me to the last point. If we have these vertical&#x27;s of people localized to specific regions, you cannot have specific outsourcing of jobs. You would need a batch outsourcing of jobs from IC&#x27;s to managers.

You as a company, unless you can spin an entirely new vertical, will back-fill employees from the mid-west again since the remaining team is located in that region. Thereby creating a pocket of talent. Enough pockets of talents will create many companies that want to hire that talent. This is what we effectively have today in major cities.

One is paying for a cheaper labor market. The second is paying for less skilled people. Most of the projected cost savings come from the latter. Most of those projected cost savings don&#x27;t appear. I remember folks hiring $10&#x2F;hr DBAs in India and the result was about what you&#x27;d expect.

Well, except for most of those folks who are willing to relocate will eventually accept offers with FANG companies either locally or relocate. So it&#x27;s a nice scheme while it works. (Hi to all my tico friends now at Google and Amazon)Remote: this is what most people confuse for the above two things. Remote is about doing 2 things.1) Expanding your hiring pool beyond a 30 minute commute from your office (turns out that the other 99.99% of the world&#x27;s population also has some great folks).2) Making your company culture remote-first. But that&#x27;s synonymous with writing things down and documenting things.Sure interpersonal relationships can be trickier to bootstrap and that&#x27;s a real cost. But see #1, nobody talks about that cost.The final thing to keep in mind is that for most big companies, there&#x27;s no way to avoid the remote cost. As soon as you open up an office in another location you&#x27;re a remote company. Hell, as many people can attest as soon as you ask people to attend meetings on another floor or an adjacent building you find out you&#x27;re a remote company.','comment',23340025,'shanemhansen',23337857,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-28 15:31:36','2020-05-31 22:26:48'),(5487,392,'I&#x27;ve been working remote with an on-site team for a few years, and well, I&#x27;m not sure as everyone of that remote will be the default as the pandemic ends.

There is nothing in the task that called out for deno but I wanted to try it out and so I did.I basically worked on the script iteratively, doing small changes, running it, checking the output, fixing things and running again. No bundler, no complex NPM tasks. Just a simple spaghetti JS and a single binary engine to run it. It was a very refreshing experience.

You cannot ask it to let one script access the file system, another access network and the rest of them run fully sandboxed.

In fact, Node was far worse in many ways. npm was extremely unstable back then, for example, which often made it impossible to use. Deno doesn&#x27;t have that problem. Node had to create libraries from scratch and invent a ton of non-standard things along the way to do it.

It’s because of the hard work ethic, and Confucian culture, that drives them to succeed.Otherwise, you only need to look at other British colonies, like South Africa, and see how much of a failure they are.

The people of Hong Kong always knew that their autonomy was only till the time when the lease ends.Interestingly, When the union flag was raised over Possession Point on 26 January 1841, the population of Hong Kong island was about 7,450, mostly Tanka fishermen and Hakka charcoal burners living in a number of coastal villages.

Was the retinal projection tech ever real, even in an imperfect, non-miniaturised form?Also, I stumbled upon a Variety piece [1] about a Magic Leap conference that sounds straight out of HBO&#x27;s Silicon Valley:&gt;However, Magic Leap decided to go a different route. When its CEO Rony Abovitz took the stage at the beginning of the conference’s opening keynote, he vaguely framed the company’s technology as a remedy to political and other divisions plaguing today’s world, postulating: “Our new medium of spatial computing is fresh. It doesn’t carry the baggage and negative headlines that are dominating the news today.”...&gt;“The conversation that we are starting here goes on for decades,” proclaimed Abovitz. He went on to talk about Magic Leap’s idea to build city-wide AR information layers — an interesting idea, but not anything we should expect to materialize any time soon, as he freely admitted, while inexplicably bringing up the spectre of fascism:&gt;“There is gonna be other companies proposing alternate x-verses. There will be all these competing universes and systems, like there is competing governments. There is monarchy, there is democracy, there is fascism, and there is progressive, liberal thought. And these holistic systems will be how governance might happen. How many people live their life. And this is not tomorrow, this might be a few years from now. But you set the stage for that right now.”&gt;Abovitz seemed to sense that there was still some work to be done before Magic Leap could defeat fascism in the Magicverse — and he promptly proposed to host a Burning Man-style gathering to get it done:&gt;“In order to continue this conversation, we probably kind of need a Burning Man in the desert. Like a kind of Magicverse event where we hang out for a few days, do a vision quest, build weird things.

When I started looking digging into the platform as a developer the feeling was exactly the same: care and refinements were almost omnipresent in every aspect of the platform.While bugs - and even nasty ones - have never been aliens on Mac OS X&#x2F;macOS, what I&#x27;ve personally started to experience in the past few years is a feeling of neglect toward the platform.Yes, Catalyst seems to go against this trend: its intent, though, is to ease the porting effort of iOS applications to Mac. A certainly laudable goal.What would probably be more laudable for Mac users and developers are: core platform stability and quality, API stability, developer documentation overhaul [1].Our CI breaks every single time there&#x27;s a minor macOS update and&#x2F;or an Xcode update: we&#x27;re at the point where our macOS UITests (XCTest) require more maintenance to keep working than the application itself.\nXCTest on macOS has ridiculous bugs. I lost count of the radars we&#x27;ve opened, and the sample apps for reduction we&#x27;ve sent to Apple.At every single minor macOS upgrade, few users complain that our application &quot;doesn&#x27;t work anymore&quot; in certain cases. And to be exquisitely blunt: there ain&#x27;t wrong with the application itself.\nRebooting after a macOS upgrade fixes whatever event tap regression we hit in Quartz.In general, what I&#x27;d personally like to see:* a less &quot;hysterical&quot; approach to the OS would be so. much. appreciated.

Proof: (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtc.edu&#x2F;net-arch)First off, this is a great starting point! There is a goal for every year, the courses clearly build upon each other, and there is an end-goal. I am a big advocate for project-based learning, and I&#x27;m seeing more employers seriously consider portfolios like GitHub and blogs. No employer cares that you got a 103% on your algorithms exam, and few vaguely care about your GPA. They do care if you can hold a conversation about a topic. They do care if you applied the knowledge, like building something that uses a tree, even if you didn&#x27;t explicitly write all the data structure code yourself.This curriculum is designed for the elite, think a student that would do well at Stanford. This is probably an obvious comment, as the majority of courses come from Stanford, but it&#x27;s important to note that the breakneck speed of this curriculum targets the top 1-5% percentile of students. If our hypothetical freshman is a high school graduate they need to have done well on the BC Calculus, AP Statistics, and AP Computer Science exams at minimum. It also assumes that the student has enough computer experience to pick up advanced skills rapidly. You could argue that &quot;Introduction to Computer Systems&quot; and &quot;Programming Fundamentals&quot; are entry level, but reading carefully they are closer to the 2nd or 3rd CS course a student would take in a normal sequence. Week 2 in the programming fundamentals talks about Stacks and Queues, and Week 1 in Intro to Computer Systems introduces Unix, the CLI, and GitHub all in one week. These are very advanced topics for students that come in with 0 knowledge. You will need either rigorous admissions requirements, or prepare for a high first-year drop out rate.We tried a 4th year very similar to what was described in the article. Students could pick a final project done in partnership with industry, or report on their internship&#x2F;career if they were already in one. Students responded with &quot;What do I need to do to get full credit?&quot;, &quot;Can you give me step-by-step instructions that I can follow?&quot;, and &quot;What will be on the exam?&quot; (there are no exams in the program after year 2).\nAfter 3 years of being explicitly told what they must do to succeed, students have correctly learned that going above and beyond in a class rarely yields extrinsic benefit within the scope of a class. To put it another way, students are trained to work efficiently in a classroom environment, &quot;Exactly as hard as I need to get the exact grade I want, and not 1% more.&quot;\nIt&#x27;s not necessarily a bad mindset, but we need to train students out of habits that are bad if applied outside of the classroom. In the case of my program, we chose to set a bar in the 4th year but didn&#x27;t tell students how high to jump. This translates to removing a lot of clarity in assignment rubrics, and providing direction but not answers. A lot of students flailed, but none failed (yet!). Graduates report a smoother transition into industry.\nWe also introduced GitHub in their third year as a portfolio tool, few students have enough knowledge to understand and use it before then. At the end of every quarter students build a final project in groups, and apply all of the skills that go into a good repository (collaborators, pull requests, readmes, CI, etc.). While not all employers are looking at the actual projects, all students who have graduated thus far have said they used the knowledge of talking about a project in interviews.\nOn the internship&#x2F;project classes&#x2F;research front, unless you are using your reputation to open those doors for students (as I had to), a student&#x27;s best chance of arbitrary contribution is through GitHub Issues and PRs. Your college&#x27;s reputation is also a major factor here; In the case of my specific college, Amazon Web Services won&#x27;t work with us because of a teaching agreement that went sour before I was hired.Some critiques from others I&#x27;d like to comment on, in lieu of the author:\n&quot;Why isn&#x27;t there core class X?&quot; - Most students can&#x27;t handle more than 2 core classes per quarter. That means 24 core classes over a 4 year period. Choose wisely. I think the author chose well, but no plan survives it&#x27;s first encounter. My curriculum certainly didn&#x27;t, and 3 years in we&#x27;ve thrown out almost all of the curriculum we initially wrote.&quot;No ethics, soft skills?&quot; - This is a core class curriculum. Electives and additional classes for &quot;rounding out&quot; a student occur during at a later phase of curriculum design, usually when it&#x27;s time to meet accreditation standards. \nFrom there you will not like the second part of this answer. In my 3 year study on building an IT bachelor&#x27;s (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsf.gov&#x2F;awardsearch&#x2F;showAward?AWD_ID=1601140), we found ethics training to work AGAINST a student&#x27;s hiring prospects (cue pitchforks). Our Business and Industry Leadership Team (representatives from technology companies) rated &quot;teaching ethics&quot; at an average of 2.1&#x2F;5 (A 2 means slight disagree that this should be taught). They marked &quot;ethical knowledge application&quot; at 1.4&#x2F;5 (A 1 means strongly disagree that this is important). The BILT team commented that they were unlikely to listen to a recent graduate&#x27;s ethical concerns on a project, they would regard a graduate raising the concerns as a &#x27;nuisance&#x27;, and that they would fire the graduate if their ethical concerns significantly impacted their job performance (cue more pitchforks).\nFinally, consider the fresh graduate&#x27;s perspective.

As a content editor having to wait 5 minutes for your change to be deployed kinda sucks. GraphQL for loading data often felt overkill and a lot of hassle.

It took me over a minute to build a personal blog.\n- Weird forced implementation of GraphQL. To display something as simple as an image I was forced to use GraphQL. Also your GraphQL can&#x27;t be dynamically generated, meaning it&#x27;s hard to make anything modular. And the GraphQL paths has a ton of extraneous nested fields (eg. `data.file.childImageSharp.fixed`)\n- Version upgrades were a pain in the ass and would often break my site.\n- My site actually seemed slow. For example, links don&#x27;t work until the entire JS loads and executes, so if your internet isn&#x27;t fast then your website basically isn&#x27;t functional for the first 2-5 seconds despite the page being visible.\n- Very few themes (maybe be better now, but at the time the selection was awful, especially compared to Jekyll). No real concept of themes in the first place, switching from one theme to another requires an entire code rewrite.\n- Limited functionality built-in. For example, want tagging? You&#x27;ll need to code that in.Gatsby sits in an odd spot of not being simple enough to save you a lot of time or empower a non-technical person to manage (eg. like WordPress), but not flexible enough to do anything you want since it&#x27;s an opinionated SSG framework. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re getting all the complexity of a React&#x2F;GraphQL application, without any of the flexibility of being able to pick your own stack.Sure it has a nice plugin system, but beyond that since you need a developer to set up and maintain a Gatsby site anyways, I don&#x27;t see any reason not to just use Next.js (which can export to static) since all Gatsby really does beyond that is converting markdown to HTML, which is just done through an npm library anyways. If writing a Next.js website is overkill, then why do you need to be devoting engineering resources to this in the first place? Why not just use some no-code solution like WordPress? Or if you really want a separate headless CMS, then Jekyll felt easier and faster to me with more theme options (though again it&#x27;s been a year since I touched these, so I imagine things have improved).Don&#x27;t get me wrong I love SSGs as nothing beats the performance, ease of deployment, and low cost of static sites. But if I&#x27;m going to use a SSG framework, it better be dead simple and&#x2F;or easy to customize, otherwise I might as well just use some off-the-shelf &quot;no-code&quot; solution (eg. WordPress, Wix, Squarespace), or use a framework like Next.js that let&#x27;s me customize my stack instead of being locked into Gatsby&#x27;s.

But this one really doesn&#x27;t qualify. It falls squarely in the category of reasonable opinions. Let&#x27;s look at the claim: &quot;There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent&quot;. Clearly the veracity of the statement rests on the word &quot;substantially.&quot; It&#x27;s inconceivable that no one ever takes, for example, an elderly relative&#x27;s mail in ballot and votes it fraudulently. So for this to be a reasonable opinion, it merely has to be reasonably possible for the claim to be true.So, let&#x27;s consider if such fraud could possibly be substantial. Let&#x27;s use California as an example. Registering to vote is easy, all you need is a web browser[1] and a mailing address where you reside or with a resident willing to give you ballots or ignorant that they are receiving them[2]. Also, the State of California faces an impractically large legal hurdle to reject suspected fraudulent ballots[3] so it can be assumed that most if not all will be accepted. It seems clear based on the observable facts that substantial fraud is certainly possible under the California regime. Please note I am not claiming such fraud actually happens, merely that it is easily practicable for an organization as well organized as, say, a political party. To be honest, I bet literally hundreds if not thousands of readers on this site could build &quot;California vote fraud as as service&quot; as a side gig.

Or maybe no viable entries?  That&#x27;s ridiculous.Here&#x27;s some spitballing: (eh, I removed this.  I don&#x27;t think brainstorming how to committ election fraud is a good idea.  I&#x27;m assuming that readers of hacker news can probably figure out some relatively obvious ways of casting doubt into the outcome of a mail in election)How are people looking at what recently happened with 100s of millions of dollars of fraud being committed against various US unemployment systems, and not thinking that other systems might be at risk as well?Remember the Iowa caucus?  That was a hastily put together vote reporting system, not even meant for tallying, and look at what a disaster it was.  Now we&#x27;re expecting that states will radically alter their voting system, in 5 months, and that it won&#x27;t be vulnerable to interference?To be clear: I LIKE mail in voting.  I have permanent mail in voting status in my state (Arizona), and my wife and I usually get breakfast at our favorite restaurant and spend HOURS meticulously researching every candidate and BI on the form.  Being able to take that amount of time is fantastic, and a luxury I wish everybody could have.But it doesn&#x27;t have to be so polar.  I like mail in voting, obviously, but I&#x27;m not so stupid as to think that it cannot possibly be criticized.  I am a hacker after all.Boo to twitter for this.  This is twitter obviously putting their finger on the scale of an election, and after all of the drama surrounding the idea that foreign actors might have purchased a few 10s of thousands of dollars of facebook ads, I&#x27;d hope that Americans would have a distrust a company where foreign entities have a major stake doing such a thing.  Not acceptable in my opinion.Just to highlight my point a little further: here is an article from the nytimes highlighting that mail in voting is far more vulnerable to fraud than in person voting: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;as-more-vote-...Here’s a quote from the article:&gt;Yet votes cast by mail are less likely to be counted, more likely to be compromised and more likely to be contested than those cast in a voting booth, statistics show.and another:&gt; Election experts say the challenges created by mailed ballots could well affect outcomes this fall and beyond.And another:&gt; The trend will probably result in more uncounted votes, and it increases the potential for fraud.

I like the little inclusion before tweets, but there&#x27;s no sources on them. Then when you scroll down on the tweets I see them in this order: The Hill, WaPo, CNN, a CBS News reporter, a Fortune Magazine reporter, a Vox reporter, Sr Political Reporter for Huffington, ACLU Nebraska, a CNN political correspondent.The issue here is that everything here is considered in the hard left of the media. I&#x27;m concerned that this will only help grow the divide between Americans, though I also don&#x27;t have a better alternative to this. Clearly there is a lack of coverage of this from the right and in fact the opposite. A quick DDG search of &quot;fox news mail in ballot&quot; pulls up [0][1][2]. So when you see things like this I think it is easier to say that &quot;the left&quot; is trying to trick you. If Fox is your primary source of news, then it does look like Twitter is trying to silence a real issue. If Fox isn&#x27;t your primary source of news then it looks like Twitter is trying to fight misinformation. Things are so crazy that it really is hard to find the truth and there is very good reason to believe that someone is lying. And no one wants to admit that someone they&#x27;ve trusted for a long time is lying to them, especially when there&#x27;s nuggets of truth that you can hold onto.So I&#x27;m a little worried about the repercussions of this, especially since the right already thinks Twitter is supporting the left.Edit: By hard left I mean from the perspective of Fox viewers. My main point is about the perspective of the people this is specifically aimed at. While on the left we don&#x27;t see it that way go talk to your friends on the right, they see it differently.

If you give someone VPN access, you need to hire a full time guy to manage that bucket of pain if you want granular per-user permissions at the network-level. Web has no such problems. Everything is typically a completely independent security context in terms of network for any layer below HTTP. VPN means you have ~layer 3+ access by default to everything on that network.There is an argument to be made for &quot;XYZ doesn&#x27;t have a web interface&#x2F;API&quot;. But, I pose that this is a weak argument in 2020. Every cloud provider can be automated 100% via API calls. Every single thing you can do on the GitHub[Lab] web UI can be automated. Even if there isn&#x27;t an explicit API, you can automate literally any legacy application with some mild scripting and duct tape. I&#x27;ve seen automation that samples a 3d application output in real-time and checks pixel colors for eventing, so I know this can be done. Bonus points here because these are typically legacy static and never-changing systems so you can code for it 1 time. There aren&#x27;t really any excuses in my shop for manual labor. Setting up a new public webapp that can 2FA your employees and provision cloud resources via the AWS JSON API is not hard. You can make it hard, but you can also make it very very easy if you just focus on the value angle.

Housing is scarce on many reservations which means large family groupings.  Now, I understand some visitors from DC think its great that families live together like &quot;the old days&quot;, but its not great, or cultural, and it sucks.  Overcrowding isn&#x27;t fun and not having access to the normal (e.g. mortgage from bank) with going through the tribe or a special program is really an issue.  A former college president lived in his parents basement until he and his wife could afford to buy a house outright (well, a mobile that they moved).  Its gotten better in recent years (better federal program), but large crowded houses get infected fairly fast.The National Guard has been doing mass testing in ND and did do one on the reservation.  It looked well organized and they were pushing a lot of people through.  I was told later (we had the window blinds to the parking lot closed to avoid any privacy violations) that they had no positives.I do wonder about the statistical differences between reservations and versus the general population.  I am not always confident on the reported statistics.','comment',23325237,'protomyth',23322253,NULL,NULL,'2020-05-27 14:00:21','2020-05-31 22:53:23'),(6090,418,'The article doesn&#x27;t really go into why the reservations were worse hit than other US areas.

I think there&#x27;s a real distinction to be made between web pages and web applications. HN seems to have a bias against web applications which is probably unfair.Most web developers today do not set out to build web pages. They start with full-on experiences they would like to bring to users, and the web stack is their tool of choice in doing so. There is nothing wrong with this! And different considerations apply in the development of such applications versus a web page.Philosophically, SourceHut is about non-browser-based workflows (e.g. using email for merge requests). Since SourceHut users do far less of their SourceHut-related work on the actual website, SourceHut can afford to take a web page approach. GitHub, in contrast, focuses on browser-based workflows. They actually do a pretty great job at it - and this is something that they can do only because they take a web application approach. I like their keyboard shortcuts, for example, but these would be difficult (impossible?) to implement on a simple HTML page.No single user can say that one approach is right and the other is wrong. All they can do is assert preferences. At the end of the day, traffic does the talking.But thinking in terms of web pages vs. web applications makes things like this:&gt; Many companies have written checks with an uncomfortable number of zeroes on them to get the job done.more understandable.','comment',23326424,'zomglings',23324225,'[23329748, 23329780]',NULL,'2020-05-27 15:09:55','2020-05-31 22:54:05'),(6123,421,'&gt; The user is already comfortable with the way their browser works, and you will fail to capture the  subtle nuances of their user agent with your pretty imitations.Amen! One form of browser imitation that particularly annoys me is client-side page loading. This is where JavaScript code intercepts activation of links, loads the new page using XHR or the like, then updates the current DOM in-place. Yes, this gives web developers the opportunity to prefetch pages or do fancy animations. But the accessibility problem here is that there&#x27;s no way for an implementation of this technique to signal to a screen reader that a page loaded just as if the browser itself had loaded the page. Yes, you can use an ARIA live region to make a screen reader read your own message when you&#x27;ve finished loading the page. But I want my screen reader to be in control of what it does when a new page loads, e.g. automatically reading the contents of the page, possibly in a user-configurable way.

Inoculation is not guaranteed to be effective against covid. Just because there was a version of it called variolation that worked against smallpox before being eliminated because it was not as good as other approaches does not mean inoculation is automatically safe and effective against a completely unrelated virus. Other coronavirus are known to display antibody dependent enhancement, where a weak immune response makes following infections worse, and we already don&#x27;t see consistent, strong responses from people who were sick.What the economist Hanson is essentially suggesting is that we take a worse method of immunization (just the normal live virus) and waive the regulatory burden to show safety and efficacy because a similar approach worked with smallpox. If we are getting into the business of ignoring the requirement for an immunization approach to be clinically validated, then there are a few dozen vaccines with far better theoretical safety and efficacy profiles that we should be using instead.

Does each type get code-generated serializers&#x2F;deserializers or maybe it&#x27;s done with reflection? Whether this feature is useful entirely depends on exactly how fast this serialization is.How does the remote code execution transmit code?

The trick of evolution is not random mutations, etc., but has to do with statistical properties of large population groups. A population that is of sufficient size will have variation within the constraints of the fitness function. How those variations are achieved is not really even that important except as regards the rate of evolution, rather than the effect of it.But the fitness function is extremely complex; it&#x27;s not just changing a few parameters. A population of land-dwellers is largely indifferent to the ability to float; so some creatures can float better, others float worse, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. But at some point the floaters get good enough at floating that they can actually swim, and now there&#x27;s a whole new fitness landscape to explore.

But you didn&#x27;t each the meal. That is, let&#x27;s not confuse the model of experience with experience.Extending that analogy I cannot argue that my life experience is similar, equivalent, or exchangeable with African Americans because I haven&#x27;t lived their experience under, say, American police. Still I am concerned that if this analogy is taken too far, there will arise an insuperable gap that will work against binding each party into the whole we seek or ought to be seeking.Our -- or THE - American Constitution sets forth equality among us all regardless of creed, color, sex, or religion, but when some of us go to the restaurant we aren&#x27;t served or, worse, there&#x27;s no food and no kitchen for us. America is not living up to the goal despite having fine goals. I recall Cornel West saying civil rights was due not because the Blacks wanted a piece of the pie -- a backhanded reference to government handouts for undeserving people -- but because preferential treatment based on color was never part of the deal. There&#x27;s no white guilt at play here anymore than there&#x27;s handouts going on.So, let&#x27;s be clear: violating civil rights is morally, ethically wrong. And all the more when it&#x27;s perpetrated by sections of society that have greater power, money, and institutional agency. And all the more when cops are supposed to hold the line on justice. Justice is the good line: if you&#x27;re on the wrong side, you should have to pay in the criminal or civil penalty. And if you&#x27;re on the right side then all to the good. Either way, then, there&#x27;s no room to take offense.As I understand it the cop with the knee on the throat of a handcuffed black man was finally charged. Well, big deal: it took them long enough to get to the stunningly obvious. I am hoping the FED charges will follow. And then civil charges. There&#x27;s also the issue of the other officers on the scene and whatever games were played by the DA and its affiliates.Hackernews is primarily about technology, tech corporations, and business. However, let&#x27;s over master the lesson so that we realize the ultimate money lesson with plenty of banked savings to boot: money is not the measurement of all things. We can and must insist there&#x27;s equality under the law for each and everyone of us. Let&#x27;s all work to make sure there&#x27;s enforceable norms which is also, beyond income, an important piece of security for us and our families.I have kids; I know why their skin color is like mine. They had no choice in the matter. And for those parents, sisters, or brothers of African Americans who fell into this society, we cannot be using and abusing and violating their rights. Standing by in a dismissive stance --- a Canadian guy who works as a FTE at my&#x2F;our American company said we Americans need to get our ____ together like it wasn&#x27;t his problem too --- is not help.Maybe I cannot eat the menu.

I imagine the rank-and-file for the most part despise Trump but as a business Twitter (and its shareholders) are more than happy to be the Propaganda Wing of the Republican Party.So I imagine an effort to distance themselves from the outright lies of the commander-in-chief was token resistance to this role, probably aimed at mollifying the collective consciences of the employees.But it&#x27;s doomed and they&#x27;ve fallen into a trap. Here&#x27;s how this is going to go:There is simply no line in the sand you can draw between objective truth and objective lies. What&#x27;s more, even if you can, propagated lies exist because people want to believe them and they see any effort to disabuse them of their provably false views (eg vaccines cause autism) as biased actors trying to hide the &quot;truth&quot;.Human nature can be ugly at times.The take on Section 230 is actually an interesting one and I imagine that&#x27;s going all the way to the Supreme Court if the administration pushes on this. Like you can remove objectionable or illegal content from your platform (in fact you&#x27;re required to by law) and still maintain safe harbor but where does that end? If you&#x27;re Google you don&#x27;t want Youtube filled up with a bunch of racist crap. It&#x27;s bad for your brand. That content may fall under free speech (from a S230 perspective) and if you decide to remove it for the health of the platform and&#x2F;or the value of your brand, does safe harbor still apply?Whatever the case, this administration needs to lose in the next election. Badly. The attack on societal norms and institutitotions is unprecedented and reprehensible and I so would like Trump, McConnell, Ivanka, Jared, Pompeo, Barr and a whole bunch of others to end up in prison after all this is over.This is what scares me the most: in the Watergate era even Republicans found Nixon&#x27;s behaviour beyond the pale. I am utterly convinced that if that happened today there&#x27;d be a strict party-line vote as the President&#x27;s party would happily look the other way.Look no further than the administration&#x27;s so far successful efforts to block Congressional oversight. At no time in history did any administration think it was totally above the law. Make no mistake: that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing. Worse, no administration so blatantly engaging in obstruction would&#x27;ve continued to have ~40% of the population support it no matter what. Thanks to decades of gerrymandering in state Houses and voter suppression that 40% almost controls the election by itself as higher-population states are essentially disenfranchises in the modern electoral system.For the record, I&#x27;m against the popular vote deciding the presidential election but that&#x27;s a whole other topic.How anyone who can call themselves &quot;Christian&quot; and support this president and his policies is utterly beyond me.','comment',23335361,'cletus',23334830,'[23335579]',NULL,'2020-05-28 07:41:54','2020-05-31 23:06:44'),(6476,450,'Very good.
