You can download an AMP document, render it, attach it to an email to a friend, etc., without having to log in or get tracked.

You write code in SQL, a programming language unlike any other mainstream programming language. Instead of writing code with for loops and if statements, you write it with joins and where clauses. On top of that, Postgres has a &amp;quot;magical query optimizer&amp;quot; that takes your SQL and figures out how to execute your query. Unless you have a good understanding of indexes and how they impact the query optimizer, you&amp;#x27;ll have a hard time getting Postgres to be fast.
